           Federal 
              Marriage Amendment   
         
            TOPIC: Domestic Policy Related 
            June 5, 2006 
            Floor Statement of Senator Barack Obama 
            Federal Marriage Amendment 
            Complete Text  
              
              Today, we take up the 
              valuable time of the U.S. Senate with a proposed amendment to our 
              Constitution that has absolutely no chance of passing. 
             We do this, allegedly, 
              in an attempt to uphold the institution of marriage in this country. 
              We do this despite the fact that for over two hundred years, Americans 
              have been defining and defending marriage on the state and local 
              level without any help from the U.S. Constitution at all. 
             And yet, we're here anyway 
              because it's an election year - because the party in power has decided 
              that the best way to get voters to the polls is not by talking about 
              Iraq or health care or energy or education, but about a constitutional 
              ban on same-sex marriage that they have no chance of passing. 
             Now, I realize that for 
              some Americans, this is an important issue. And I should say that 
              personally, I do believe that marriage is between a man and a woman. 
             But let's be honest. That's 
              not what this debate is about. Not at this time. 
             This debate is an attempt 
              to break a consensus that is quietly being forged in this country. 
              It's a consensus between Democrats and Republicans, liberals and 
              conservatives, Red States and Blue States, that it's time for new 
              leadership in this country - leadership that will stop dividing 
              us, stop disappointing us, and start addressing the problems facing 
              most Americans. 
             It's a consensus between 
              a majority of Americans who say, "You know what, maybe some 
              of us are comfortable with gay marriage right now and some of us 
              are not. But most of us do believe that gay couples should be able 
              to visit each other in the hospital and share health care benefits; 
              most of us do believe that they should be treated with dignity and 
              have their privacy respected by the federal government." 
             And we all know that if 
              this amendment were to pass, it would close the door on much of 
              this - because we know that when similar amendments passed in places 
              like Ohio and Michigan and Utah, domestic partnership benefits were 
              taken away from gay couples. 
             This is not what the majority 
              of the American people want. And this is not about trying to build 
              consensus in this country; it's not about trying to bring people 
              together. 
             This is about winning an 
              election. That's why the issue was last raised in July of 2004, 
              and that's why we haven't heard about it again until now. And while 
              this is supposedly a measure that the other party raised to appeal 
              to some of its core supporters, I don't know how happy I'd be if 
              my party only talked about an issue I cared about right around election 
              time - especially if they knew it had no chance of passing. 
             I agree with most Americans, 
              with Democrats and Republicans, with Vice President Cheney, with 
              over 2,000 religious leaders of all different beliefs, that decisions 
              about marriage, as they always have, should be left to the states. 
             Today, we should take this 
              amendment only for what it is - a political ploy designed to rally 
              a few supporters and draw the country's attention away from this 
              leadership's past failures and America's future challenges. 
             There is plenty of work 
              to be done in this country. There are millions without health care 
              and skyrocketing gas prices and children in crumbling schools and 
              thousands of young Americans risking their lives in Iraq. 
             So don't tell me that this 
              is the best use of our time. Don't tell me that this is what people 
              want to see talked about on TV and in the newspapers all day. We 
              wonder why the American people have such a low opinion of Washington 
              these days. This is why. 
             We are better than this. 
              And we certainly owe the American people more than this. I know 
              that this amendment will fail, and when it does, I hope we can start 
              discussing issues and offering proposals that will actually improve 
              the lives of most Americans.
