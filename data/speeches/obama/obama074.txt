            Death of Rosa Parks - Senate Floor Statement 
            Complete Text  
             
              Mr. President, today the nation mourns a genuine 
              American hero. Rosa Parks died yesterday in her home in Detroit. 
              Through her courage and by her example, Rosa Parks helped lay the 
              foundation for a country that could begin to live up to its creed. 
             Her life, and her brave actions, reminded each and 
              every one of us of our personal responsibilities to stand up for 
              what is right and the central truth of the American experience that 
              our greatness as a nation derives from seemingly ordinary people 
              doing extraordinary things. 
             Rosa Parks' life was a lesson in perseverance. As 
              a child, she grew up listening to the Ku Klux Klan ride by her house 
              and lying in bed at night fearing that her house would be burnt 
              down. In her small hometown in Alabama, she attended a one-room 
              school for African-American children that only went through the 
              sixth grade. When she moved to Montgomery, Alabama, to continue 
              her schooling, she was forced to clean classrooms after school to 
              pay her tuition. Although she attended Alabama State Teachers College, 
              Rosa Parks would later make her living as a seamstress and housekeeper. 
             But she didn't accept that her opportunities were 
              limited to sewing clothes or cleaning houses. In her forties, Rosa 
              Parks was appointed secretary of the Montgomery branch of the NAACP 
              and was active in voter registration drives with the Montgomery 
              Voters League. In the summer of 1955, she attended the Highlander 
              Folk School, where she took classes in workers' rights and racial 
              equality. Well before she made headlines across the country, she 
              was a highly respected member of the Montgomery community and a 
              committed member of the civil rights effort. 
             Of course, her name became permanently etched in 
              American history on December 1, 1955, when she was arrested for 
              refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery 
              bus. It wasn't the first time Rosa Parks refused to acquiesce to 
              the Jim Crow system. The same bus driver who had her arrested had 
              thrown her off a bus the year before for refusing to give up her 
              seat. 
             Some schoolchildren are taught that Rosa Parks refused 
              to give up her seat because her feet were tired. Our nation's schoolbooks 
              are only getting it half right. She once said: "The only tired 
              I was, was tired of giving in." 
             This solitary act of civil disobedience became a 
              call to action. Her arrest led a then relatively unknown pastor, 
              Martin Luther King, Jr., to organize a boycott of the Montgomery 
              bus system. That boycott lasted 381 days and culminated in a landmark 
              Supreme Court decision finding that the city's segregation policy 
              was unconstitutional. 
             This solitary act of civil disobedience was also 
              the spark that ignited the beginning of the end for segregation 
              and inspired millions around the country and ultimately around the 
              world to get involved in the fight for racial equality. 
             Rosa Parks' persistence and determination did not 
              end that day in Montgomery, nor did it end with the passage of the 
              Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act years later. She stayed active 
              in the NAACP and other civil rights groups for years. From 1965 
              to 1988, Ms. Parks continued her public service by working for my 
              good friend Congressman John Conyers. And in an example of her low-key 
              demeanor, her job in Congressman Conyers' office did not involve 
              appearances as a figurehead or celebrity; she helped homeless folks 
              find housing. 
             At the age of 74, she opened the Rosa and Raymond 
              Parks Institute for Self-Development, which offers education and 
              job training programs for disadvantaged youth. And even into her 
              80s, Rosa Parks gave lectures and attended meetings with civil rights 
              groups. 
             At the age of 86, Rosa Parks' courage and fortitude 
              was recognized by President Bill Clinton, who awarded her the nation's 
              highest honor for a civilian - the Congressional Gold Medal. 
             As we honor the life of Rosa Parks, we should not 
              limit our commemorations to lofty eulogies. Instead, let us commit 
              ourselves to carrying on her fight, one solitary act at a time, 
              and ensure that her passion continues to inspire as it did a half-century 
              ago. That, in my view, is how we can best thank her for her immense 
              contributions to our country. 
             Rosa Parks once said: "As long as there is 
              unemployment, war, crime and all things that go to the infliction 
              of man's inhumanity to man, regardless - there is much to be done, 
              and people need to work together." Now that she's passed, it's 
              up to us to make sure that her message is shared. While we will 
              miss her cherished spirit, let's work to ensure that her legacy 
              lives on in the heart of the nation. 
             As a personal note, I think it is fair to say were 
              it not for that quiet moment of courage by Mrs. Parks, I would not 
              be standing here today. I owe her a great thanks, as does the Nation. 
              She will be sorely missed. 
             Thank you. I yield the floor.
