            October 2002 Barack Obama's 2002 Speech Against the Iraq War 
            Illinois State senator 
            The Federal Plaza in Chicago 
            Complete Text  
             
              I stand before you as someone who is not opposed to war in all circumstances. 
              The Civil War was one of the bloodiest in history, and yet it was 
              only through the crucible of the sword, the sacrifice of multitudes, 
              that we could begin to perfect this union and drive the scourge 
              of slavery from our soil. 
             I don't oppose all wars. 
              My grandfather signed up for a war the day after Pearl Harbor was 
              bombed, fought in Patton's army. He fought in the name of a larger 
              freedom, part of that arsenal of democracy that triumphed over evil. 
             I don't oppose all wars. 
             After September 11, after 
              witnessing the carnage and destruction, the dust and the tears, 
              I supported this administration's pledge to hunt down and root out 
              those who would slaughter innocents in the name of intolerance, 
              and I would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy 
              from happening again. 
             I 
              don't oppose all wars. What I am opposed to is a dumb war . 
              What I am opposed to is a rash war. What I am opposed to is the 
              cynical attempt by Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz and other armchair, 
              weekend warriors in this administration to shove their own ideological 
              agendas down our throats, irrespective of the costs in lives lost 
              and in hardships borne. 
             What I am opposed to is 
              the attempt by political hacks like Karl Rove to distract us from 
              a rise in the uninsured, a rise in the poverty rate, a drop in the 
              median income, to distract us from corporate scandals and a stock 
              market that has just gone through the worst month since the Great 
              Depression. 
             That's what I'm opposed 
              to. A dumb war. A rash war. A war based not on reason but on passion, 
              not on principle but on politics. 
             Now let me be clear: I 
              suffer no illusions about Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal man. A 
              ruthless man. A man who butchers his own people to secure his own 
              power.... The world, and the Iraqi people, would be better off without 
              him. 
             But I also know that Saddam 
              poses no imminent and direct threat to the United States, or to 
              his neighbors...and that in concert with the international community 
              he can be contained until, in the way of all petty dictators, he 
              falls away into the dustbin of history. 
             I know that even a successful 
              war against Iraq will require a U.S. occupation of undetermined 
              length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences. 
             I know that an invasion 
              of Iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international 
              support will only fan the flames of the Middle East, and encourage 
              the worst, rather than best, impulses of the Arab world, and strengthen 
              the recruitment arm of al-Qaeda. 
             I am not opposed to all 
              wars. I'm opposed to dumb wars. So for those of us who seek a more 
              just and secure world for our children, let us send a clear message 
              to the president. 
             You want a fight, President 
              Bush? Let's finish the fight with Bin Laden and al-Qaeda, through 
              effective, coordinated intelligence, and a shutting down of the 
              financial networks that support terrorism, and a homeland security 
              program that involves more than color-coded warnings. 
             You want a fight, President 
              Bush? Let's fight to make sure that...we vigorously enforce a nonproliferation 
              treaty, and that former enemies and current allies like Russia safeguard 
              and ultimately eliminate their stores of nuclear material, and that 
              nations like Pakistan and India never use the terrible weapons already 
              in their possession, and that the arms merchants in our own country 
              stop feeding the countless wars that rage across the globe. 
             You want a fight, President 
              Bush? Let's fight to make sure our so-called allies in the Middle 
              East, the Saudis and the Egyptians, stop oppressing their own people, 
              and suppressing dissent, and tolerating corruption and inequality, 
              and mismanaging their economies so that their youth grow up without 
              education, without prospects, without hope, the ready recruits of 
              terrorist cells. 
             You want a fight, President 
              Bush? Let's fight to wean ourselves off Middle East oil through 
              an energy policy that doesn't simply serve the interests of Exxon 
              and Mobil. 
             Those are the battles that 
              we need to fight. Those are the battles that we willingly join. 
              The battles against ignorance and intolerance. Corruption and greed. 
              Poverty and despair. 
              The consequences of war are dire, the sacrifices immeasurable. We 
              may have occasion in our lifetime to once again rise up in defense 
              of our freedom, and pay the wages of war. But we ought not – 
              we will not – travel down that hellish path blindly. Nor should 
              we allow those who would march off and pay the ultimate sacrifice, 
              who would prove the full measure of devotion with their blood, to 
              make such an awful sacrifice in vain.
