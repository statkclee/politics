            Military Commission Legislation Statement 
            Complete Text  
              
             Mr. President, I am proud 
              to be sponsoring this amendment with the senior senator from West 
              Virginia. He's absolutely right that Congress has abrogated its 
              oversight responsibilities, and one way to reverse that troubling 
              trend is to adopt a sunset provision in this bill. We did that in 
              the Patriot Act, and that allowed us to make important revisions 
              to the bill that reflected our experience about what worked and 
              didn't work during the previous 5 years. We should do that again 
              with this important piece of legislation. 
             But I want to take a few 
              minutes to speak more broadly about the bill before us. 
             I may have only been in 
              this body for a short while, but I am not naive to the political 
              considerations that go along with many of the decisions we make 
              here. I realize that soon, we will adjourn for the fall, and the 
              campaigning will begin in earnest. And there will be 30-second attack 
              ads and negative mail pieces, and we will be criticized as caring 
              more about the rights of terrorists than the protection of Americans. 
              And I know that the vote before us was specifically designed and 
              timed to add more fuel to that fire. 
             And yet, while I know all 
              of this, I'm still disappointed. Because what we're doing here today 
              - a debate over the fundamental human rights of the accused - should 
              be bigger than politics. This is serious. 
             If this was a debate with 
              obvious ideological differences - heartfelt convictions that couldn't 
              be settled by compromise - I would understand. But it's not. 
             All of us - Democrats and 
              Republicans - want to do whatever it takes to track down terrorists 
              and bring them to justice as swiftly as possible. All of us want 
              to give our President every tool necessary to do this. And all of 
              us were willing to do that in this bill. Anyone who says otherwise 
              is lying to the American people. 
             In the five years that 
              the President's system of military tribunals has existed, not one 
              terrorist has been tried. Not one has been convicted. And in the 
              end, the Supreme Court of the United found the whole thing unconstitutional, 
              which is why we're here today. 
             We could have fixed all 
              of this in a way that allows us to detain and interrogate and try 
              suspected terrorists while still protecting the accidentally accused 
              from spending their lives locked away in Guantanamo Bay. Easily. 
              This was not an either-or question. 
             Instead of allowing this 
              President - or any President - to decide what does and does not 
              constitute torture, we could have left the definition up to our 
              own laws and to the Geneva Conventions, as we would have if we passed 
              the bill that the Armed Services committee originally offered. 
             Instead of detainees arriving 
              at Guantanamo and facing a Combatant Status Review Tribunal that 
              allows them no real chance to prove their innocence with evidence 
              or a lawyer, we could have developed a real military system of justice 
              that would sort out the suspected terrorists from the accidentally 
              accused. 
             And instead of not just 
              suspending, but eliminating, the right of habeas corpus - the seven 
              century-old right of individuals to challenge the terms of their 
              own detention, we could have given the accused one chance - one 
              single chance - to ask the government why they are being held and 
              what they are being charged with. 
             But politics won today. 
              Politics won. The Administration got its vote, and now it will have 
              its victory lap, and now they will be able to go out on the campaign 
              trail and tell the American people that they were the ones who were 
              tough on the terrorists. 
             And yet, we have a bill 
              that gives the terrorist mastermind of 9/11 his day in court, but 
              not the innocent people we may have accidentally rounded up and 
              mistaken for terrorists - people who may stay in prison for the 
              rest of their lives. 
             And yet, we have a report 
              authored by sixteen of our own government's intelligence agencies, 
              a previous draft of which described, and I quote, "...actions 
              by the United States government that were determined to have stoked 
              the jihad movement, like the indefinite detention of prisoners at 
              Guantanamo Bay..." 
             And yet, we have Al Qaeda 
              and the Taliban regrouping in Afghanistan while we look the other 
              way. We have a war in Iraq that our own government's intelligence 
              says is serving as Al Qaeda's best recruitment tool. And we have 
              recommendations from the bipartisan 9/11 commission that we still 
              refuse to implement five years after the fact. 
             The problem with this bill 
              is not that it's too tough on terrorists. The problem with this 
              bill is that it's sloppy. And the reason it's sloppy is because 
              we rushed it to serve political purposes instead of taking the time 
              to do the job right. 
             I've heard, for example, 
              the argument that it should be military courts, and not federal 
              judges, who should make decisions on these detainees. I actually 
              agree with that. The problem is that the structure of the military 
              proceedings has been poorly thought through. Indeed, the regulations 
              that are supposed to be governing administrative hearings for these 
              detainees, which should have been issued months ago, still haven't 
              been issued. Instead, we have rushed through a bill that stands 
              a good chance of being challenged once again in the Supreme Court. 
             This is not how a serious 
              Administration would approach the problem of terrorism. I know the 
              President came here today and was insisting that this is supposed 
              to be our primary concern. He's absolutely right it should be our 
              primary concern - which is why we should be approaching this with 
              a somberness and seriousness that this Administration has not displayed 
              with this legislation. 
             Now, let me be clear - 
              for those who plot terror against the United States, I hope God 
              has mercy on their soul, because I certainly do not. And for those 
              who our government suspects of terror, I support whatever tools 
              are necessary to try them and uncover their plot. 
             But we also know that some 
              have been detained who have no connection to terror whatsoever. 
              We've already had reports from the CIA and various generals over 
              the last few years saying that many of the detainees at Guantanamo 
              shouldn't have been there - as one U.S. commander of Guantanamo 
              told the Wall Street Journal, "Sometimes, we just didn't get 
              the right folks." And we all know about the recent case of 
              the Canadian man who was suspected of terrorist connections, detained 
              in New York, sent to Syria, and tortured, only to find out later 
              that it was all a case of mistaken identity and poor information. 
             In the future, people like 
              this may never have a chance to prove their innocence. They may 
              remain locked away forever. 
             And the sad part about 
              all of this is that this betrayal of American values is unnecessary. 
              We could've drafted a bipartisan, well-structured bill that provided 
              adequate due process through the military courts, had an effective 
              review process that would've prevented frivolous lawsuits being 
              filed and kept lawyers from clogging our courts, but upheld the 
              basic ideals that have made this country great. 
             Instead, what we have is 
              a flawed document that in fact betrays the best instincts of some 
              of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle - those who worked in 
              a bipartisan fashion in the Armed Services Committee to craft a 
              bill that we could have been proud of. And they essentially got 
              steamrolled by this Administration and by the imperatives of November 
              7th. 
             That is not how we should 
              be doing business in the U.S. Senate, and that's not how we should 
              be prosecuting this war on terrorism. When we're sloppy and cut 
              corners, we are undermining those very virtues of America that will 
              lead us to success in winning this war. At bare minimum, I hope 
              we can at least pass this provision so that cooler heads can prevail 
              after the silly season of politics is over. Thank you.
