                AMENDMENT TO PROVIDE MEALS AND PHONE SERVICE TO WOUNDED VETERANS 
             
         
            TOPIC: Veterans April 14 , 2005 
            Statement of Senator Barack Obama 
            Amendment to Provide Meals and Phone Service to Wounded Veterans 
            Complete Text    Mr. 
              President, today I am offering an amendment to the fiscal year 2005 
              Emergency Supplemental, which I am pleased to announce is being 
              cosponsored by Senators Corzine, Bingaman, and Graham. This amendment 
              would meet certain needs of our injured service members in recognition 
              of the tremendous sacrifices they have made in defense of our country. 
             The other day 
              I had the opportunity to visit some of our wounded heroes at Walter 
              Reed Army Medical Center. 
             I know that many 
              of my colleagues have made the same trip and I'd heard about their 
              visits, but there is nothing that can fully prepare you for what 
              you see when you take that first step into the Physical Therapy 
              room. 
             These are kids 
              in there. Our kids. The ones we watched grow up. The ones we hoped 
              would live lives that were happy, healthy, and safe. These kids 
              left their homes and families for a dangerous place halfway around 
              the world. After years of being protected by their parents, these 
              kids risked their lives to protect us. 
             And now, some 
              of them have come home from that war with scars that may change 
              their lives forever - scars that may never heal. And yet they sit 
              there in that hospital, so full of hope and still so proud of their 
              country. 
             These kids are 
              the best of America. They deserve our highest respect, and they 
              deserve our help. 
             Recently, I learned 
              that some of our most severely wounded soldiers are being forced 
              to pay for their own meals and their own phone calls while being 
              treated in medical hospitals. 
             Up until last 
              year, there was a law on the books that prohibited soldiers from 
              receiving both their basic subsistence allowance and free meals 
              from the military. Basically, this law allowed the government to 
              charge our wounded heroes for food while they were recovering from 
              their war injuries. 
             Thankfully, this 
              body acted to change this law in 2003 so that wounded soldiers wouldn't 
              have to pay for their meals. 
             But, we're dealing 
              with a bureaucracy here, and as we all know, nothing is ever simple 
              in a bureaucracy. So now, because the Department of Defense doesn't 
              consider getting physical therapy or rehabilitation services in 
              a medical hospital as "being hospitalized," there are 
              wounded veterans who still do not qualify for the free meals other 
              veterans receive. And after 90 days, even those classified as hospitalized 
              on an outpatient status lose their free meals as well. 
             Also, while our 
              soldiers in the field qualify for free phone service, injured service 
              men and women who may be hospitalized hundreds or thousands of miles 
              from home do not receive this benefit. 
             For soldiers whose 
              family members aren't able to take off work and travel to a military 
              hospital, hearing the familiar voice of a mom or dad or husband 
              or wife on the other side of the phone can make all the difference 
              in the world. 
             And yet, our government 
              will not help pay for these calls. And it will not help pay for 
              those meals. 
             Think about that. 
              Think about the sacrifice these kids have made for their country, 
              many of them literally risking life and sacrificing limb. 
             And now, at $8.10 
              a meal, they could end up with a $250 bill from the government that 
              sent them to war every single month. This is wrong, and we have 
              a moral obligation to fix it. 
             The first amendment 
              that I'm offering today will do this. It will expand the group of 
              "hospitalized" soldiers who cannot be charged for their 
              meals to include those service members undergoing medical recuperation, 
              therapy or otherwise on "medical hold." The number of 
              people affected by this amendment will be small. Only about 4000 
              service members are estimated to fall under the category of "non-hospitalized." 
             The amendment 
              is retroactive to January 1, 2005, in an effort to provide those 
              injured service members who may have received bills for their meals 
              with some relief from those costs. The amendment will also extend 
              free phone service to those injured service members who are hospitalized 
              or otherwise undergoing medical recuperation or therapy. I am proud 
              that this amendement is supported by the American Legion, and I 
              hope my colleagues will join them in that support. 
             I ask my colleagues 
              to join me in supporting this amendment. These are our kids out 
              there, and they're risking their lives for us. When they come home 
              with injuries, the government that asked these kids to serve should 
              provide them with the best possible care and support. This is a 
              small price to pay for those who have sacrificed so much for their 
              country. 
             I thank the Senior 
              Senator from Alaska and my colleague from Mississippi for working 
              with me on this issue. I am hopeful we can reach an agreement on 
              this.
