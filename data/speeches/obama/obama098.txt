              2005 Remarks at TechNet Complete Text 
               
              
             Thank you John Doer. It's great to be here with 
              all of you today, and I'm honored that you've given me the opportunity 
              to join this discussion about the role technology can play in our 
              future and our children's future. And before we begin, I'd just 
              like to recognize your CEO, Rick White, who is leaving TechNet after 
              years of inspired leadership and service to this organization and 
              this country. Thank you Rick. 
             We're here today because when it comes to the global 
              economy, the rules of the game have changed. This is a fact not 
              only understood by a roomful of Silicon Valley CEOs, but by families 
              I met all across Illinois during the campaign. They know that when 
              it comes to their jobs and their wages, they're not only competing 
              with workers in Naperville and Carbondale, but in New Delhi and 
              Calcutta. What's more, they know that when it comes to the high-tech, 
              high skill jobs of the future, their children are not only competing 
              with children here in the United States, but with those on the other 
              side of the globe who are increasingly being educated earlier, longer, 
              and with a special emphasis on the math and science skills required 
              for the industries of tomorrow. 
             These families tell me that they're anxious about 
              their future. They worry that they could become the first generation 
              of Americans to see their children do worse than they did. They 
              remember that when we were all growing up, our parents knew that 
              if they pushed us to study and work hard, the best universities 
              would be open to us and we could get any job we wanted. But today, 
              parents in cities and towns all over America are losing that hope 
              - they're losing the sense that their kids will be able to dream 
              the American dream. 
             The rules of the game have changed. And so we must 
              change with them. But in a country of innovators and optimists - 
              a country that pioneered the first moon landing, discovered the 
              cure for polio, and led the technological revolution of the nineties 
              - I have no doubt that we can. This is the great project for our 
              time, and so it must become a larger part of the debate in our politics, 
              our businesses, our schools and our homes. 
             The good news is that we have the resources, we 
              have the brainpower, and we are still an economic and technological 
              giant. In Illinois alone we have 238,000 high-tech workers. The 
              University of Illinois at Champagne-Urbana is where Marc Andreesen 
              developed Mosaic, the browser that made the World Wide Web what 
              it is today. And right now at Argonne National Laboratory, scientists 
              are developing the technology for "grid computing" - which 
              IBM and others believe represents the future of the IT industry. 
             All across America, world-class universities, first-rate 
              research facilities and brilliant minds are on the cusp of discovering 
              the next big idea that will lift up the quality of our lives, create 
              millions of new jobs, and change our world. We can take comfort 
              in knowing that, but we can't take it for granted, because right 
              now other countries are looking at places like Silicon Valley and 
              North Carolina's Research Triangle and saying "we want that." 
              They're investing in better universities, expanding research budgets 
              and venture capital, producing more science and engineering graduates, 
              and passing innovation-friendly public policies. 
             None of us expect or want the government to lead 
              the next technological revolution, but I believe that we can provide 
              the spark that fuels America's innovation and competitiveness in 
              the global economy. I believe we can do better than cutting the 
              budget for the National Science Foundation, as this year's budget 
              has done for the first time. We can do better than falling to 10th 
              place in the world when it comes to providing people with access 
              to Broadband. We can do better when it comes to using technology 
              to free ourselves from America's dangerous dependence on Mideast 
              oil. We can do better than burdening businesses with cases of class 
              action abuse, and that's why I cast a tough vote in favor of reform 
              the other week. 
             And we can do better, think bigger, and act bolder 
              when it comes to education in this country. The best part about 
              Bill Gates' speech last week was when he said that our schools are 
              in danger of becoming obsolete as tools to educate tomorrow's workers 
              for tomorrow's jobs. But schools are where our children's dreams 
              begin, and so schools are where we must begin to make those dreams 
              come true. 
             We shouldn't wait until high school either. We have 
              to start the way Jim Barksdale of Netscape did when he gave a big 
              grant and a lot of hope to preschoolers in Mississippi. We can't 
              leave kids behind before they even enter the first grade, and that's 
              why I'll continue to focus on early childhood education as a way 
              to give them the best start in life. 
             We also know that some of the best ideas in education 
              don't come from Washington, but from local schools all over America. 
              That's why charter schools are a great way for us to learn from 
              experiments in Topeka and Springfield that schools in Chicago and 
              L.A. can replicate in their own classrooms. And because the success 
              of your businesses depend on your ability to fill jobs with great 
              minds, we need more corporate and private investment in our schools. 
              John Doer's work with the New Schools Venture Fund is leading the 
              way on this front, and we should all commend him for that. 
             As parents and citizens, each of us has a stake 
              in making sure that our schools are doing everything possible to 
              give our kids the competitive edge they'll need in a 21st century 
              economy. The tests we have now are great ways to gather information 
              about what works and what doesn't, but they're not enough. I believe 
              that to meet tomorrow's challenges, we should create a national 
              network of academies to train 25,000 new teachers and get them into 
              high-need rural and urban schools. We should give local schools 
              the latest technology training tools as John Chambers has done with 
              the CISCO Networking Academy Program. When I was at the University 
              of Chicago, other faculty members and myself developed a program 
              where we essentially adopted primary schools to help them learn 
              how to use the technological opportunities they were being offered. 
              It's not enough just to set down a computer in a classroom and walk 
              away - we must also train teachers and administrators on how to 
              use that computer and its technology to find new and better ways 
              of educating our children. 
             Finally, we should work to close the gap that is 
              widening between America and the rest of the world when it comes 
              to math and science graduates. 
             To do this, we must start by inspiring our children 
              with a sense of purpose...by nurturing their imagination so that 
              they may dream big and then work hard to reach those dreams. Too 
              often, our children spend hours playing Playstation without ever 
              finding out how to build Playstation. They watch television but 
              never wonder how it's put together. They surf web page after web 
              page on the Internet, but are never taught how to design one. 
             The incredible story of progress that is America 
              has always been built by those who ask why, what if, and why not. 
              Our schools must begin instilling that wonder in our children again 
              so that their generation will unite around the next great project 
              of our time, whether it be declaring America energy independent 
              or launching the next great technological revolution. 
             Too often, the debate about education here in Washington 
              degenerates to old arguments and stale ideas. And so it's time to 
              put aside partisan differences and just talk about what works for 
              our kids and what will keep America competitive in this new century. 
              Those are goals we all have and hopes we all share. 
             Yes, the rules of the game have changed. And now 
              it's time for us to prove to the world that we can still play better 
              than anyone. The families I've met are ready to try. Their kids 
              are ready. TechNet is ready. And in the coming months, I will do 
              my best to work with my colleagues and make sure our government 
              is ready too. I want to thank TechNet for doing your part to get 
              this dialogue going, and now I'd like to take a few questions from 
              the audience. Thank you.
