                 CONFIRMATION HEARING OF JOHN BOLTON   
             
         TOPIC: Confirmations   April 
            11 , 2005 
            Opening Statement of Senator Barack Obama 
            Confirmation Hearing of John Bolton   
            Mr. Chairman and Senator Biden, the position of United States Permanent 
            Representative to the United Nations is one of the most important 
            diplomatic positions in the entire U.S. government.   
              
             Some of the most distinguished Americans - Democrats 
              and Republicans like Daniel Patrick Moynihan, George H.W. Bush, 
              and Henry Cabot Lodge - have served with honor in this position. 
             Yet, there is one man from my home state of Illinois 
              whose experience as Permanent Representative is quite relevant today. 
             Adlai Stevenson served in this position during the 
              Cuban Missile Crisis. And, as we all know, it was Stevenson's presentation 
              to the U.N. Security Council that proved to the world that the Soviets 
              were moving intermediate range missiles into Cuba. Using charts 
              and photos to build a compelling case, Stevenson declared to Soviet 
              Ambassador Zorin that he was prepared to wait "until Hell freezes 
              over" for Zorin's response to the U.S. charges. 
             What few people remember is that Stevenson's presentation 
              came on the heels of what one might call an "intelligence failure." 
              A year earlier, Stevenson had been misled by the White House and 
              the CIA into publicly stating that the United States was not behind 
              the Bay of Pigs invasion. Stevenson almost resigned over the incident. 
             This series of events is important to keep in mind 
              today. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, we were able to succeed 
              diplomatically because of the stature and integrity of our Permanent 
              Representative to the United Nations. In fact, President Kennedy 
              said that, "the integrity and credibility of Adlai Stevenson 
              constitute one of our greatest national assets." 
             As a result, Adlai Stevenson was able to get tough, 
              isolate the Soviets, and convince the world we were right. 
             Today, we face a similar situation. With the rest 
              of the world questioning our intelligence capabilities, and nuclear 
              proliferation threats from Iran to North Korea that may require 
              action by the U.N. Security Council, we must be able to convince 
              the world that we are right. Now, more than ever, we need a credible 
              messenger at the U.N. 
             Unfortunately, I have some serious reservations 
              about whether Mr. Bolton is the right man for the job: 
             First, senior U.S. intelligence officials have called 
              into question Mr. Bolton's credibility on statements he's made about 
              non-proliferation. There are also accusations related to political 
              pressure on intelligence analysts who did not agree with Mr. Bolton's 
              statements. Considering that he's the top arms control official 
              at the State Department, this is troubling to say the least. 
             Second, Mr. Bolton's history of inflammatory statements 
              about the U.N. would seem to make it more difficult for him to advance 
              U.S. interests at the U.N. I am concerned about whether Mr. Bolton 
              even believes the U.N. is a viable institution and a useful instrument 
              of U.S. foreign policy. Saying that it wouldn't make a difference 
              if you lop off ten floors of the UN building in New York isn't exactly 
              the best way to earn people's respect and support - whatever the 
              context. 
             Finally, Mr. Bolton appears to have an overly confrontational 
              history with several member-states on the Security Council. Like 
              Adlai Stevenson, I believe there are times to be tough. But statements 
              like "I don't do carrots" coming from someone who wants 
              to be our chief diplomat at the U.N. certainly give me pause. 
             Mr. Chairman, there is no question that we need 
              someone in New York who is unafraid to shake things up and challenge 
              the status quo. But, we also need someone with the credibility, 
              temperament, and diplomatic skill to work with other nations, form 
              coalitions, and advance U.S. interests. 
             That is why I've invoked the memory of Adlai Stevenson 
              here today: he was tough; he was credible; he was diplomatic. Most 
              importantly, he was effective. Stevenson proved that we should not 
              make compromises or trade-offs when selecting our Representative 
              to the U.N. 
             I want to give Mr. Bolton a chance to speak on these 
              issues, and so my mind is not made up yet. I want to hear from him 
              as to how he can be an effective and credible advocate for the U.S. 
              I look forward to hearing his testimony and answers to the Committee's 
              questions.
