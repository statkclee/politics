                THE NUCLEAR OPTION  
             
         TOPIC: Foreign Policy & Defense Wednesday, 
             April 13 , 2005 
            Statement of Senator Barack Obama 
            The Nuclear Option Washington, DC 
            Complete Text   Mr. President, 
              I rise today to urge my colleagues to think about the implications 
              the nuclear option would have on this chamber and this country. 
              I urge you to think not just about winning every debate, but about 
              protecting free and democratic debate. 
             During my Senate 
              campaign, I had the privilege and the opportunity to meet Americans 
              from all walks of life and both ends of the political spectrum. 
              They told me about their lives, about their hopes, about the issues 
              that mattered to them, and they also told me what they think about 
              Washington. 
             Because you've 
              all heard it yourselves, I know it won't surprise many of you to 
              learn that a lot of people don't think much gets done around here 
              about the issues they care most about. They think the atmosphere 
              has become too partisan, the arguments have become too nasty, and 
              the political agendas have become too petty. 
             And while I haven't 
              been here too long, I've noticed that partisan debate is sharp, 
              and dissent is not always well-received. Honest differences of opinion 
              and principled compromise often seem to be the victim of a determination 
              to score points against one's opponents. 
             But the American 
              people sent us here to be their voice. They understand that those 
              voices can at times become loud and argumentative, but they also 
              hope that we can disagree without being disagreeable. And at the 
              end of the day, they expect both parties to work together to get 
              the people's business done. 
             What they don't 
              expect is for one party - be it Republican or Democrat - to change 
              the rules in the middle of the game so that they can make all the 
              decisions while the other party is told to sit down and keep quiet. 
              The American people want less partisanship in this town, but everyone 
              in this chamber knows that if the majority chooses to end the filibuster 
              - if they choose to change the rules and put an end to democratic 
              debate - then the fighting and the bitterness and the gridlock will 
              only get worse. 
             I understand that 
              Republicans are getting a lot of pressure to do this from factions 
              outside the chamber. But we need to rise above an "ends justify 
              the means" mentality because we're here to answer to the people 
              - all of the people - not just the ones wearing our party label. 
             The fact is that 
              both parties have worked together to confirm 95% of this President's 
              judicial nominees. The Senate has accepted 205 of his 214 selections. 
              In fact, we just confirmed another one judge this week by a vote 
              of 95-0. Overall, this is a better record than any President's had 
              in the last 25 years. For a President who received 51% of the vote 
              and a Senate chamber made up of 55% of the President's party, I'd 
              say that confirming 95% of your judicial nominations is a record 
              I'd be pretty happy with. 
             Again, I urge 
              my Republican colleagues not to go through with changing these rules. 
              In the long run, this is not a good result for either party. One 
              day Democrats will be in the majority again, and this rule change 
              will be no fairer to a Republican minority than it is to a Democratic 
              minority. 
             Mr. President, 
              I sense that talk of the nuclear option is more about power than 
              about fairness. I believe some of my colleagues propose this rules 
              change because they can get away with it rather than because they 
              know it's good for our democracy. 
             Right now, we're 
              faced with rising gas prices, skyrocketing tuition costs, a record 
              number of uninsured Americans, and some of the most serious national 
              security threats we've ever had, all while our bravest young men 
              and women are risking their lives halfway around the world to keep 
              us safe. 
             These are challenges 
              we all want to meet and problems we all want to solve, even if we 
              don't all agree how to do it. But if the right of free and open 
              debate is taken away from the minority party and the millions of 
              Americans who asked us to be their voice, I fear that the already 
              partisan atmosphere of Washington will be poisoned to the point 
              where no one will be able to agree on anything. That doesn't serve 
              anyone's best interests, and it certainly isn't what the patriots 
              who founded this democracy had in mind. 
             We owe the people 
              who sent us here more than that. We owe them much more. 
             Thank you.
