            TOPIC: Foreign Policy & Defense 
            February 9, 2006 
            Foreign Relations Committee 
            Lugar-Obama legislation S.1949 
            Complete Text  
             
              Mr. Chairman, I can't do a better job of laying 
              out the issue than you just did, so I am going to keep my opening 
              remarks relatively short. 
             I want to thank you for your tireless leadership 
              on this issue; for holding this hearing; and for working with me 
              to introduce what I believe is a very good bill. I also want to 
              thank Senator Biden for his insightful comments and his long track 
              record of good work on nonproliferation issues. 
             The Lugar-Obama legislation, S.1949, does two basic 
              things. 
             First, it enhances our ability, working with friends 
              and allies, to detect and intercept illegal shipments of weapons 
              and materials of mass destruction. Second, the bill bolsters ongoing 
              efforts to destroy conventional weapons such as lightweight anti-aircraft 
              missiles. 
             As the Chairman pointed out in his opening statement, 
              many of these efforts are under-funded, fragmented, and in need 
              of high-level support. I take note of the Chairman's comments that 
              new threat reduction proposals - even the Nunn-Lugar program - are 
              not always warmly received by the Executive Branch. 
             I agree with your testimony Secretary Joseph that 
              the Department does need flexibility to deal effectively with global 
              threats and international diplomacy. But that isn't the issue here 
              before us today. Every Member of this Committee wants to give the 
              State Department the flexibility it needs. 
             This issue here today is whether the State Department 
              could use additional resources and coordination to more effectively 
              deal with two critically important threats - interdiction of WMD 
              and destruction of conventional weapons. I believe it can. 
             I am also concerned that the issue just simply does 
              not get the attention it deserves within the State Department. 
             I know that both the President and Secretary Rice 
              have expressed their commitment to nonproliferation issues. But, 
              four key State Department interdiction and nonproliferation programs 
              are either flat-lined or slated for only modest of increases in 
              the President's budget. Meanwhile, a $1.2 billion increase is proposed 
              for the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), which will provide funding 
              to nations such as Cape Verde, Madagascar, and Vanuatu. 
             I am supportive of the MCA, and I am not saying 
              that these countries aren't worthy of U.S. assistance. But, a budget 
              is about prioritizing strategic objectives. And, in my view, the 
              priorities don't appropriately align with the strategic threats 
              we confront today. 
             Secretary Joseph, despite my concerns, I am hopeful 
              that we can work together to make adjustments to our budget priorities. 
              With regard to Lugar-Obama, I am also confident that we can work 
              in a collaborative spirit to make a good bill even better. I look 
              forward to your testimony.
