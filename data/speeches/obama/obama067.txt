                Senate Floor Statement - The PATRIOT Act 
             
         
            TOPIC: Homeland Security 
            December 15, 2005 
            Senate Floor Statement of Senator Barack Obama 
            The PATRIOT Act 
            Complete Text  
             
              Four years ago, following the most devastating 
              attack in our history, this body passed the USA PATRIOT Act in order 
              to give our nation's law enforcement the tools they need to track 
              down terrorists who plot and lurk within our own borders and all 
              over the world - terrorists who, right now, are looking to exploit 
              weaknesses in our laws and our security to carry out even deadlier 
              attacks than we saw on September 11th. 
             We all agree that we needed legislation to make 
              it harder for suspected terrorists to go undetected in this country. 
              And we all agree we needed to make it harder for them to organize 
              and strategize and get flight licenses and sneak across our borders. 
              Americans everywhere wanted that. 
             But soon after the PATRIOT Act passed, a few years 
              before I ever arrived in the Senate, I began hearing concerns from 
              people of every background and political leaning that this law - 
              the very purpose of which was to protect us - was also threatening 
              to violate our rights and freedoms as Americans. That it didn't 
              just provide law enforcement the powers it needed to keep us safe, 
              but powers it didn't need to invade our privacy without cause or 
              suspicion. 
             In Washington, this issue has tended degenerate 
              into an "either-or" type debate. Either we protect our 
              people from terror or we protect our most cherished principles. 
              But that is a false choice. It asks too little of us and assumes 
              too little about America. 
             That's why as it's come time to reauthorize this 
              law, we've been working in a bipartisan way to do both - to show 
              the American people that we can track down terrorists without trampling 
              on our civil liberties. To show the American people that the federal 
              government will only issue warrants and execute searches because 
              it needs to, not because it can. What we have been trying to achieve, 
              under the leadership of a bipartisan group of Senators, is some 
              accountability in this process - to get answers and see evidence 
              where there is suspicion. 
             Several weeks ago, this work bore fruit. The Judiciary 
              Committee and the U.S. Senate managed to pass a piece of bi-partisan 
              legislation that, while I can't say is perfect, was able to address 
              many of these most serious problems in the existing law. 
             Unfortunately, that strong bi-partisan legislation 
              has been tossed aside in Conference. Instead, we have been forced 
              to consider a piece of rushed legislation that fails to address 
              the concerns of members of both parties as well as the American 
              people. 
             This is legislation that puts our own Justice Department 
              above the law. When National Security Letters are issued, they allow 
              federal agents to conduct any search on any American, no matter 
              how extensive or wide-ranging, without ever going before a judge 
              to prove that the search is necessary. They simply need sign-off 
              from a local FBI official. That's all. 
             Once a business or a person receives notification 
              that they will be searched, they are prohibited from telling anyone 
              about it, and they are even prohibited from challenging this automatic 
              gag order in court. Even though judges have already found that similar 
              restrictions violate the First Amendment - this Conference Report 
              disregards the case law and the right to challenge the gag order. 
             If you do decide to consult an attorney for legal 
              advice - you have to tell the FBI that you have done so. This is 
              unheard of - there is no such requirement in any other area of law, 
              and I don't see why it is justified here. 
             And if someone wants to know why their own government 
              has decided to go on a fishing expedition through every personal 
              record or private document - through library books they've read 
              and phone calls they've made - this legislation gives people no 
              rights to appeal the need for such a search in a court of law. No 
              judge will hear their plea, no jury will hear their case. 
             This is just plain wrong. 
             Giving law enforcement the tools they need to investigate 
              suspicious activity is one thing - and it's the right thing - but 
              doing it without any real oversight seriously jeopardizes the rights 
              of all Americans and the ideals America stands for. 
             Supporters of this Conference Report have argued 
              that we should just hold our noses and support the legislation, 
              because it's not going to get any better. That does not convince 
              me that I should support this report. I believe we owe it to the 
              nation to do whatever we can to make this legislation better. We 
              don't have to settle for a PATRIOT Act that sacrifices our liberties 
              or our safety - we can have one that secures both. 
             There have been proposals on both sides of Congress, 
              from both parties, to extend the PATRIOT Act for three months so 
              that we can reach agreement on this bill. I support those efforts 
              and will oppose cloture on this unacceptable Conference Report.
