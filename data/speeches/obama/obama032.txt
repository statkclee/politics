                Floor Statement on Iraq Debate 
             
         
            TOPIC: Iraq 
            June 21, 2006 
            Floor Statement of Senator Barack Obama on Iraq Debate 
            Complete Text  
             
              Mr. President, in October 
              of 2002, I delivered a speech opposing the War in Iraq. 
             I said that Saddam Hussein 
              was a ruthless man, but that he posed no imminent and direct threat 
              to the United States. 
             I said that a war in Iraq 
              would take our focus away from our efforts to defeat al-Qaeda. 
             And, with a volatile mix 
              of ethnic groups and a complicated history, I said that the invasion 
              and occupation of Iraq would require a U.S. occupation of undetermined 
              length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences. 
             In short, I felt the decision 
              unfolding then to invade Iraq was being made without a clear rationale, 
              based more on ideology and politics than fact and reason. 
             It is with no great pleasure 
              that I recall this now. Too many young men and women have died. 
              Too many have been maimed. Too many hearts have been broken. I fervently 
              wish I had been wrong about this war; that my concerns had been 
              unfounded. 
             America and the American 
              people have paid a high price for the decision to invade Iraq and 
              myriad mistakes that followed. I believe that history will not judge 
              the authors of this war kindly. 
             For all these reasons, 
              I would like nothing more than to support the Kerry Amendment; to 
              bring our brave troops home on a date certain, and spare the American 
              people more pain, suffering and sorrow. 
             But having visited Iraq, 
              I'm also acutely aware that a precipitous withdrawal of our troops, 
              driven by Congressional edict rather than the realities on the ground, 
              will not undo the mistakes made by this Administration. It could 
              compound them. 
             It could compound them 
              by plunging Iraq into an even deeper and, perhaps, irreparable crisis. 
             We must exit Iraq, but 
              not in a way that leaves behind a security vacuum filled with terrorism, 
              chaos, ethnic cleansing and genocide that could engulf large swaths 
              of the Middle East and endanger America. We have both moral and 
              national security reasons to manage our exit in a responsible way. 
             I share many of the goals 
              set forth in the Kerry Amendment. We should send a clear message 
              to the Iraqis that we won't be there forever, and that by next year 
              our primary role should be to conduct counter-insurgency actions, 
              train Iraqi security forces, and provide needed logistical support. 
             Moreover, I share the frustration 
              with an Administration whose policies with respect to Iraq seem 
              to simply repeat the simple-minded refrains of "we know best" 
              and "stay the course." It's not acceptable to conduct 
              a war where our goals and strategies drift aimlessly regardless 
              of the cost in lives or dollars spent, and where we end up with 
              arbitrary, poll-driven troop reductions by the Administration - 
              the worst of all possible outcomes. 
             As one who strongly opposed 
              the decision to go to war and who has met with servicemen and women 
              injured in this conflict and seen the pain of the parents and loved 
              ones of those who have died in Iraq, I would like nothing more than 
              for our military involvement to end. 
             But I do not believe that 
              setting a date certain for the total withdrawal of U.S. troops is 
              the best approach to achieving, in a methodical and responsible 
              way, the three basic goals that should drive our Iraq policy: that 
              is, 1) stabilizing Iraq and giving the factions within Iraq the 
              space they need to forge a political settlement; 2) containing and 
              ultimately defeating the insurgency in Iraq; and 3) bringing our 
              troops safely home. 
             What is needed is a blueprint 
              for an expeditious yet responsible exit from Iraq. A hard and fast, 
              arbitrary deadline for withdrawal offers our commanders in the field, 
              and our diplomats in the region, insufficient flexibility to implement 
              that strategy. 
             For example, let's say 
              that a phased withdrawal results in fifty thousand troops in Iraq 
              by July 19, 2007. If, at that point, our generals and the Iraqi 
              government tell us that having those troops in Iraq for an additional 
              three or six months would enhance stability and security in the 
              region, this amendment would potentially prevent us from pursuing 
              the optimal policy. 
             It is for this reason that 
              I cannot support the Kerry Amendment. Instead, I am a cosponsor 
              of the Levin amendment, which gives us the best opportunity to find 
              this balance between our need to begin a phase-down and our need 
              to help stabilize Iraq. It tells the Iraqis that we won't be there 
              forever so that they need to move forward on uniting and securing 
              their country. I agree with Senator Warner that the message should 
              be "we really mean business, Iraqis, get on with it." 
              At the same time, the amendment also provides the Iraqis the time 
              and the opportunity to accomplish this critical goal. 
             Essential to a successful 
              policy is the Administration listening to its generals and diplomats 
              and members of Congress - especially those who disagree with their 
              policies and believe it is time to start bringing our troops home. 
             The overwhelming majority 
              of the Senate is already on record voting for an amendment stating 
              that calendar year 2006 should be a period of significant transition 
              to full Iraqi sovereignty, with Iraqi security forces taking the 
              lead for the security, creating the conditions for the phased redeployment 
              of United States forces from Iraq. The Levin Amendment builds on 
              this approach. 
             The White House should 
              follow this principle as well. Visiting Iraq for a few hours cannot 
              resuscitate or justify a failed policy. No amount of spin or photo 
              opportunities can change the bottom line: this war has been poorly 
              conceived and poorly managed by the White House, and that is why 
              it has been so poorly received by the American people.. 
             And it's troubling to already 
              see Karl Rove in New Hampshire, treating this as a political attack 
              opportunity instead of a major national challenge around which to 
              rally the country. 
             There are no easy answers 
              to this war. I understand that many Americans want to see our troops 
              come home. The chaos, violence, and horrors in Iraq are gut-wrenching 
              reminders of what our men and women in uniform, some just months 
              out of high school, must confront on a daily basis. They are doing 
              this heroically, they are doing this selflessly, and more than 2,500 
              of them have now made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. 
             Not one of us wants to 
              see our servicemen and women in harm's way a day longer than they 
              have to be. And that's why we must find the most responsible way 
              to bring them home as quickly as possible, while still leaving the 
              foundation of a secure Iraq that will not endanger the free world.
