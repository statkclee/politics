             Hello, this is Senator 
              Barack Obama and today is Thursday, May 18th, 2006. 
             We've been having some 
              big debates here in Washington; obviously Iraq and Iran are still 
              high on the list. We've also been immersed in the immigration bill, 
              which is actually making more progress than I had expected. I'll 
              be frank with you - I was concerned that after negotiations broke 
              down that we were not going to be able to get a bill out of the 
              Senate. I think, actually, at this point that we may get a comprehensive 
              bill out of the Senate, then the challenge is going to be making 
              sure that we're able to negotiate with House members to reconcile 
              differences and ensure that we've got a piece of legislation that 
              both deals with border security, ensures that employers have to 
              verify the employment status of their employees, and also gives 
              a pathway to citizenship to the 11 to 12 million people who are 
              already here but undocumented. 
             But I want to just shift 
              gears today. This is an issue that is important to an awful lot 
              of people in Illinois, its also important to a lot of people in 
              states around the country. Some of you may recall, if you've been 
              following the work that we've been doing, that I'm on the Veterans 
              Affairs Committee and however you feel about the war in Iraq, however 
              you feel about past wars, I think all of us, Republican, Democrat, 
              urban, rural, whatever your demographic, should share in the belief 
              that when a young man or woman goes off and serves our country in 
              the military, that they should be treated with the utmost dignity 
              and respect when they come home. That should especially be true 
              for those who have suffered disabilities on the battlefield. Anybody 
              who's ever visited Walter Reed Hospital here in Washington and has 
              seen twenty year-olds and twenty-two year-olds who have had legs 
              amputated or suffered severe nerve damage I think understands they 
              have made an unbelievable sacrifice on our behalf and that we've 
              got an obligation to make sure that just as they are fighting on 
              our behalf that we are going to make sure that we fight for their 
              behalf when they come home. 
             It turned out that a number 
              of veterans in states including Illinois had been apparently short-changed 
              in terms of their disability payments. Typically, veterans who've 
              been injured receive some sort of disability payment. They are evaluated 
              by various regional offices of Veterans Affairs, and they are awarded 
              a certain percentage based on the kind of injury they've received 
              and the severity of the injury. 
             It turns out that in Illinois, 
              for a wide range of reasons, you had veterans who had been injured 
              getting paid much lower disability payments than veterans in some 
              other states - and these differences were substantial. Illinois 
              veterans, for example, were receiving 42 percent less per year than 
              some of the leading states. So, to give you an example, an average 
              disability payment to Illinois veterans would be $6,961. In New 
              Mexico, the top ranked state - same veteran, same disability - on 
              average, was getting $12,000 a year. So, obviously this wasn't acceptable 
              to me as a senator from Illinois, but it was unacceptable, I think, 
              to anybody who believes that any veteran who has served our country, 
              wherever they live, should be treated fairly and equitably. As a 
              consequence, we've moved forward and passed legislation last year 
              ensuring that, in fact, some of these differentials were dealt with. 
              We asked the VA to come to Illinois and other states that had suffered 
              some of these problems and made sure that, in fact, they started 
              assigning and retraining some of the people who were doing the evaluations. 
              The other thing is we insisted that the Veterans Administration 
              do outreach to people who have received disability payments all 
              these years and may have been short-changed. And so what happened 
              is starting this month, you had the Department of Veterans Affairs 
              sending out letters to disabled veterans in Illinois and several 
              other states indicating to them that they live in a state that has 
              received low average disability compensation and that they have 
              the right to open new claims, appeal what a veteran may consider 
              to be a bad decision, to get help from veterans service organizations, 
              in terms of processing these reevaluations that have been requested. 
             And so today I just wanted 
              to make sure that veterans were aware of this. I hope that we've 
              got some veterans on the podcast who may have been disabled and 
              are receiving benefits. If you live in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, 
              Connecticut, Ohio or New Jersey, than you live in a state in which 
              the average disability payment is substantially lower than payments 
              to disabled veterans in other states. It doesn't mean that your 
              individual payment is necessarily too low; it may have been that 
              you actually were treated fairly by the VA, but there is a possibility 
              that because you live in one of these states (Illinois, Indiana, 
              Michigan, Connecticut, Ohio or New Jersey) that, in fact, you were 
              getting a lower disability payment than you should have received. 
              The VA should have sent a letter to you to contact you, to give 
              you an opportunity to have your claim reevaluated and if you have 
              not received a letter but you are a disabled veteran that was awarded 
              a disability payment in one of those states, then you can call 1-800-827-1000. 
              That's 1-800-827-1000, or you can get on the following website: 
              www.vba.va.gov/specialoutreach. I know that's a mouthful, so what 
              you can do is get on our website and we will post on the website, 
              the VA website that is designed to do this outreach. I hope that 
              all of you take a look at this if you are a disabled veteran because 
              we want to make sure that you have been treated fairly by the VA. 
             And for those of you who 
              aren't veterans, I hope that you will continue to be supportive 
              of our veterans. Many of them have a very difficult time adjusting 
              when they first come back home. I think any of us who can imagine 
              being on the battlefield in a place like Baghdad, perhaps seeing 
              one of your friends injured or killed, seeing yourself lose a leg 
              or an arm, experiencing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, you can only 
              imagine the difficulties in making the adjustment to civilian life. 
             In fact, one of the things 
              that I'm going to be monitoring very closely is how are we treating 
              the 100,000 plus veterans who are going to be coming home and to 
              make sure the VA has the capacity to provide transition services 
              for veterans who are leaving the service and reentering civilian 
              life, particularly National Guardsmen and Reservists who perhaps 
              did not expect to be fighting in a place like Iraq. It turns out 
              that if you catch a veteran and provide them good services on the 
              way out, they are much less likely to suffer Posttraumatic Stress 
              Disorder and can make the adjustment. If some of the problems they 
              may have as a consequence of being on the battlefield are not dealt 
              with early, then they can have long-term problems, which is one 
              of the reasons why veterans are seven times more likely to be homeless 
              than non-veterans. So, that's an amazing statistic to think about. 
              It indicates the enormous toll that war, of any sort, can take on 
              our young men and women. It's also a reminder for those of us who 
              are in civilian life but have the authority to authorize war do 
              so with a great sense of responsibility and caution. 
             Anyway, it's great to talk 
              to you guys as always. I will be back on this podcast next week. 
              In the meantime, I hope everybody will continue to monitor this 
              immigration debate. I may have something more to say about it next 
              week. In the meantime, I hope everybody will continue to monitor 
              this immigration debate. I may have something more to say about 
              it next week. Bye-bye.
