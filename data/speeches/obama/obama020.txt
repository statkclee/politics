            Complete Text  
              
             THIS PARAGRAGH 
              IS SPOKEN BEFORE THE VIDEO BEGINS : 
              I want to thank first of all the King family, we would not be here 
              without them, I want to thank Mr. Johnson and the foundation for 
              allowing me to share this day with all of you. I wish to recognize 
              as well my colleagues in the United States Senate who have helped 
              make today possible. Senators Paul Sarbanes and John Warner, who 
              wrote the bill for this memorial. Senators Thad Cochran and Robert 
              Byrd who appropriated the money to help build it. Thank you all. 
             I have two daughters, ages 
              five and eight. And when I see the plans for this memorial, I think 
              about what it will like when I first bring them here upon the memorial's 
              completion. I imagine us walking down to this tidal basin, between 
              one memorial dedicated to the man who helped give birth to a nation, 
              and another dedicated to the man who preserved it. I picture us 
              walking beneath the shadows cast by the Mountain of Despair, and 
              gazing up at the Stone of Hope, and reading the quotes on the wall 
              together as the water falls like rain. 
             And at some point, I know 
              that one of my daughters will ask, perhaps my youngest, will ask, 
              "Daddy, why is this monument here? What did this man do?" 
             How might I answer them? 
              Unlike the others commemorated in this place, Dr. Martin Luther 
              King Jr. was not a president of the United States - at no time in 
              his life did he hold public office. He was not a hero of foreign 
              wars. He never had much money, and while he lived he was reviled 
              at least as much as he was celebrated. By his own accounts, he was 
              a man frequently racked with doubt, a man not without flaws, a man 
              who, like Moses before him, more than once questioned why he had 
              been chosen for so arduous a task - the task of leading a people 
              to freedom, the task of healing the festering wounds of a nation's 
              original sin. 
             And yet lead a nation he 
              did. Through words he gave voice to the voiceless. Through deeds 
              he gave courage to the faint of heart. By dint of vision, and determination, 
              and most of all faith in the redeeming power of love, he endured 
              the humiliation of arrest, the loneliness of a prison cell, the 
              constant threats to his life, until he finally inspired a nation 
              to transform itself, and begin to live up to the meaning of its 
              creed. 
             Like Moses before him, 
              he would never live to see the Promised Land. But from the mountain 
              top, he pointed the way for us - a land no longer torn asunder with 
              racial hatred and ethnic strife, a land that measured itself by 
              how it treats the least of these, a land in which strength is defined 
              not simply by the capacity to wage war but by the determination 
              to forge peace - a land in which all of God's children might come 
              together in a spirit of brotherhood. 
             We have not yet arrived 
              at this longed for place. For all the progress we have made, there 
              are times when the land of our dreams recedes from us - when we 
              are lost, wandering spirits, content with our suspicions and our 
              angers, our long-held grudges and petty disputes, our frantic diversions 
              and tribal allegiances. 
             And yet, by erecting this 
              monument, we are reminded that this different, better place beckons 
              us, and that we will find it not across distant hills or within 
              some hidden valley, but rather we will find it somewhere in our 
              hearts. 
             In the Book of Micah, Chapter 
              6, verse 8, the prophet says that God has already told us what is 
              good. 
             "What doth the Lord 
              require of thee, the verse tells us, but to do justly, and to love 
              mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" 
             The man we honor today 
              did what God required. In the end, that is what I will tell my daughters 
              - I will leave it to their teachers and their history books to tell 
              them the rest. As Dr. King asked to be remembered, I will tell them 
              that this man gave his life serving others. I will tell them that 
              this man tried to love somebody. I will tell them that because he 
              did these things, they live today with the freedom God intended, 
              their citizenship unquestioned, their dreams unbounded. And I will 
              tell them that they too can love. That they too can serve. And that 
              each generation is beckoned anew, to fight for what is right, and 
              strive for what is just, and to find within itself the spirit, the 
              sense of purpose, that can remake a nation and transform a world. 
              Thank you very much.
