                AMERICAN LEGION LEGISLATIVE RALLY REMARKS BY SENATOR BARACK OBAMA 
             
         March 1 , 2005 American Legion Legislative Rally 
            Remarks by Senator Barack Obama  
                 
             Thank you. It's an honor to be here today with all 
              of you Legionnaires. Since joining the Veterans Affairs Committee 
              last month, I've been holding town halls with veterans all over 
              Illinois, and I can tell you that in the days ahead, there will 
              be few issues I'll work harder on than ensuring that the brave men 
              and women who serve our country receive the support they deserve 
              and the benefits they've earned when they come home. 
             In the coming weeks, you'll hear a lot of debate 
              over the veterans' budget that President Bush submitted to Congress. 
              You'll hear people talk about what we can afford and what adds up 
              on paper, about where we can save money and what percentage increase 
              or decrease we should give to this program or that program. 
             But I know those aren't the first things that came 
              to your mind when you heard about this budget. And they're not the 
              first things that came to my mind either. 
             I thought about my grandfather, who signed up for 
              duty in World War II the day after Pearl Harbor. He marched across 
              Europe in Patton's army, and when he came home, it was the education 
              and opportunity offered by the GI Bill that allowed his family to 
              build their own American Dream. 
             I thought about the hundreds of Illinois veterans 
              I've met over the last few years. We asked them to leave their homes, 
              leave their families, and risk their lives in some far-off place 
              to protect us. And yet, somehow, we're still hearing stories like 
              the one I heard from a veteran named Bill Allen, who told me that 
              on a trip to Chicago, he actually saw homeless veterans fighting 
              over access to the dumpsters. That's what I thought about. And finally, 
              I thought about a young man named Seamus Ahern, who I met during 
              the campaign at a V.F.W. hall in East Moline, Illinois. He told 
              me about how he'd joined the Marines because he was so proud of 
              this country, and he felt that as a young person in his early twenties 
              he wanted to give something back. He was getting shipped out to 
              Iraq the following week, and as I listened to him explain why he?d 
              enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and its leaders, 
              his devotion to duty and service, I thought this young man was all 
              that any of us might hope for in a child. But then I asked myself: 
              When Shamus comes home, will we serve him as well as he served us? 
              That's the question we should be asking ourselves when we talk about 
              veterans' benefits and the veterans' budget. And that's the standard 
              we should meet. 
             But how do we meet that standard and serve our veterans 
              when we have a budget that, when adjusted for inflation, has even 
              less money for veterans than it did a year ago? When we have less 
              for health care, for hospitals, and for disability pay? 
             This budget tells our veterans that if you want 
              increased funding for the VA, you'll have to pay for it yourself. 
              It's a budget that charges 2.2 million veterans a $250 enrollment 
              fee just to enter into the health care program they were promised 
              upon enlisting. A budget that more than doubles veterans' prescription 
              drug co-payments. That will cut $351 million in funding for veterans' 
              nursing homes, and will eliminate more than $100 million in state 
              grants that are desperately needed by VA facilities across the country. 
             And this is a budget that tells all those veterans 
              still waiting for help to keep waiting. There are roughly 480,000 
              compensation and pension claims still unprocessed, but this budget 
              only calls for 113 new employees to help deal with this backlog 
              ? not enough to make a dent. In Chicago, veterans are waiting an 
              average of 138 days just to start the sometimes decade-long process 
              of getting their disability claim processed. 138 days. How can we 
              make our heroes wait this long? 
             As troops continue to come home from Iraq and Afghanistan, 
              the numbers and the need will only increase. We know that soldiers 
              are already coming home with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and 
              we know that a recent Army study showed that one in six soldiers 
              in Iraq reported symptoms of major depression. Some experts predict 
              that more than 100,000 soldiers may need some kind of mental health 
              treatment when they come home. For tens of thousands of others, 
              the wounds they suffered in battle will need care that could last 
              a lifetime. 
             It is not only our patriotic duty to provide this 
              care, it is our moral duty at the most fundamental level. When our 
              troops return from battle, we should welcome them with the promise 
              of opportunity, not the threat of poverty. 
             Over half a century ago, it was American Legion 
              National Commander Harry Colmery who first drafted the legislation 
              longhand that would become the GI Bill of Rights ? a bill that has 
              since provided education and training for nearly 8 million Americans, 
              housing for nearly 2 million families, and led to the creation of 
              the great American middle-class. That was a bill that told our heroes 
              "When you come home, we're here for you, because we're all 
              in this together." 
             Today, we shouldn't be scraping to find the bare 
              minimum in benefits and health care for our veterans. And with the 
              largest deployment of troops since Vietnam fighting for freedom 
              in an increasingly dangerous world, we should be talking about a 
              GI Bill for the 21st Century. 
             Fortunately, my colleague, Congressman Rahm Emanuel, 
              has just introduced such a bill. It's called the Welcome Home Package, 
              and it offers veterans the exact same health care they received 
              during their time in the service, double the education benefit they 
              receive now, and a $5,000 down payment on a home. 
             When veterans look to Congress for help, this is 
              the kind of legislation they should hear about ? not budget cuts 
              and increased fees. 
             It's time to reassess our priorities. A budget is 
              more than just a series of numbers on a page; it is an embodiment 
              of our values. The President never hesitates to praise the service 
              of our veterans and acknowledge the debt we owe them for their service, 
              and I commend him for that. Now I hope he will renew his commitment 
              by increasing funding for the VA, and ensure that our veterans receive 
              more than just words of praise, but also the health care and benefits 
              they?ve earned. 
             George Washington once said: "the willingness 
              with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter 
              how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive 
              veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by our nation." 
             Washington understood then what every veteran here 
              knows now ? that when we make the decision to send our troops to 
              war, we also make the decision to care for them, to speak for them, 
              and to think of them ? always ? when they come. Thank you and God 
              Bless you.
