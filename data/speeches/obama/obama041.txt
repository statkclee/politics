            TOPIC: Immigration 
            May 23, 2006 
            Floor Statement by Senator Barack Obama 
            Employment Verification Amendment for the Immigration Bill 
            Complete Text 
              
              Mr. President. I come to the floor today to discuss 
              the bipartisan employment verification system amendment that Senators 
              Grassley, Kennedy, Kyl, and I have introduced. 
             One of the central components of immigration reform 
              is enforcement, and this bill contains a number of important provisions 
              to beef up border security. But that's not enough. Real enforcement 
              also means drying up the pool of jobs that encourages illegal immigration. 
              And that can only happen if employers don't hire illegal workers. 
              Unfortunately, our current employer enforcement system does little 
              to nothing to deter illegal immigrants from finding work. 
             Overall, the number of workplace arrests of illegal 
              immigrants fell from 17,552 in 1997 to 451 in 2002, even as illegal 
              immigration grew during that time. Moreover, between 25% to 40% 
              of all undocumented immigrants are people who have overstayed their 
              visas. And the only way to effectively deter overstays is to reduce 
              access to employment. 
             When Congress last passed an immigration bill in 
              1986, we didn't provide a meaningful way for employers to check 
              legal eligibility to work. Currently, employees can prove their 
              legal status by showing a variety of documents, and employers are 
              supposed to record their inspection of such documents by filling 
              out an I-9 form for each employee. As a result, the market for fraudulent 
              documents -- fake Social Security cards, driver's licenses, birth 
              certificates - has exploded. 
             But, with more than 100 million employees in more 
              than 6 million workplaces, and only about 788 Wage and Hour investigators, 
              employer sanctions have become merely a nuisance requirement to 
              maintain records, not a serious risk of penalties. As a result, 
              the number of "intent to fine" notices issued to employers 
              for hiring undocumented workers dropped from 417 in 1999 to just 
              three in 2004. 
             Understandably, employers cannot always detect forged 
              documents. And employers who reject workers with questionable documents 
              risk an employment discrimination suit. 
             That's why we need a better alternative. We need 
              an electronic verification system that can effectively detect the 
              use of fraudulent documents, significantly reduce the employment 
              of illegal workers, and give employers the confidence that their 
              workforce is legal. 
             When Congress first considered comprehensive immigration 
              reform in April, the legislation on the floor addressed this problem 
              by creating a national employment eligibility verification system. 
              Senators Grassley, Kyl, and I all thought that was a good idea in 
              theory, but we had concerns with the design of the system. 
             Senators Grassley and Kyl proposed that the verification 
              system be implemented nationally within 18 months. 
             Senators Kennedy and I proposed that the system 
              be phased in over five years but that it also include additional 
              accuracy and privacy standards, as well as strict prohibitions on 
              use of the system to discriminate against workers. 
             For the past few weeks, our staffs have worked together 
              in a bipartisan effort to negotiate a substitute that took the concerns 
              of both proposals into consideration. I'm pleased that we've reached 
              an agreement. 
             Under our compromise amendment, all employers would 
              have to participate 18 months after the Department of Homeland Security 
              receives the appropriations needed to fund the system. All new employees 
              hired would have to be run through the system, and a series of privacy 
              and accuracy standards would protect citizens and legal immigrants 
              from errors in the system and breaches of private information. 
             And to make sure that employers take the system 
              seriously, we strengthen civil penalties for employers who hire 
              unauthorized workers, and we establish criminal penalties for repeat 
              violators. 
             We've worked in a constructive, bipartisan manner 
              to design an employment verification system that is fair to legal 
              workers and tough on illegal workers. This is a good amendment, 
              and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
             Thank you.
