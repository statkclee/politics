            Complete Text   
             
            Thank you, and congratulations to all of this year's Young Americans. 
 Now that you've 
              each received your award, I have one question for all of you: 
             What are you going 
              to do with it? 
             I know that after 
              you wear it out of here, your parents will proudly hang it up somewhere 
              in the house where everyone can see it. And at some point you'll 
              go off to college and, against our best wishes, probably find a 
              way to use it to open certain beverages. 
             But my question 
              is - what are you going to do with it? What are you going to make 
              of this honor and this recognition? What will it mean in your lives? 
             The committee 
              who gave you this award, your parents, all of us - we hope that 
              it means you will go on to achieve great things, find immeasureable 
              success, and discover the job of your dreams. 
             But we also hold 
              another hope. 
             You're all sitting 
              here because in each of you, someone saw a spark. 
             It's a spark that 
              goes deeper than tests and grades, varsity letters and service awards. 
              It's the spark that keeps each of you asking the questions, what 
              if, why, and why not? The one that keeps you always searching for 
              answers to those questions. The one that makes you say, "I 
              don't have to be content with the present, because I have a role 
              in changing the future." 
             What each of you 
              has is the desire to learn not just for the next test or even the 
              next diploma, but to learn for the sake of learning. To constantly 
              look around your world and seek new ways to improve it. To embrace 
              change as the inevitable engine of progress. 
             At the dawn of 
              the 21st century, when the world is changing faster than we could've 
              ever imagined, this spark, this skill - lifelong learning - is the 
              most important thing you can take with you when you graduate here. 
             Why, you're wondering. 
              What's he talking about? 
             Well, I'm talking 
              about McDonald's. 
             Some of you may 
              know that McDonald's headquarters is located over in Oak Brook, 
              Illinois. 
             But what you may 
              not know about is three very innovative McDonald's restaurants that 
              have opened around the state. 
             At these restaurants, 
              you pull up to a drive-through window to give your order. Nothing 
              new there. But while you're pondering which processed food to order, 
              your order's being processed by a voice that's sitting hundreds 
              of miles away at a call center in Colorado or even Canada. There, 
              they take a digital picture of your car, match it up with your order, 
              and send it back to the people preparing your food. This makes the 
              orders quicker, more accurate, and more profitable for McDonald's. 
             And just like 
              that, driving back to yell at the person who forgot your fries could 
              mean a 14 hour car ride. 
             So why am I telling 
              this story? What does this mean for all of you? 
             It means that 
              we haven't even begun to understand or feel the full impact of the 
              technological revolution that happened in the last decade. It means 
              walls between countries have been torn down and the global community 
              has become more connected through the internet, cell phones, video 
              phones, and other advances in communication. 
             And it leaves 
              all of you with this challenge: 
             If the miracle 
              of technology means that McDonald's can send its drive-thru jobs 
              across the country, just think of where other companies can send 
              theirs. And so while the first Young American Award winners in 1956 
              competed for jobs with kids in Illinois and Wisconsin and Iowa, 
              you'll be competing with kids from India, China, and all over the 
              world who are being educated more and longer than ever before. 
             So what do we 
              do? What can you do? 
             We can't stop 
              this, but we can be prepared for it. And as Young American award 
              winners, you've already taken the first step. 
             See, in this new 
              world, knowledge really is power. A new idea can lead not just to 
              a new product or a new job, but entire new industries and a new 
              way of thinking about the world. 
             And so you need 
              to be the Idea Generation. 
             The generation 
              who's always thinking on the cutting edge, who's wondering how to 
              create and keep the next wave of American jobs and American innovations, 
              who's figuring out how to out-compete the Idea Generations of Indias 
              and Chinas of the world. 
             They're already 
              sending drive-thru jobs across the country - what will you guys 
              do? 
             To figure this 
              out, you'll need to graduate first. Then you'll need a college diploma 
              - and we need to make sure that everyone in America is afforded 
              the chance to get one of those. 
             Last year, 220,000 
              young people gave up on their dream to go to college for the simple 
              reason that they could not afford the price of tuition, which is 
              now rising at the rate of almost 10% a year. If we have any hope 
              of competing and winning in today's economy, we cannot let our kids' 
              college dreams be dashed because of a hefty price tag. In Washington, 
              I've been trying to do something about this by introducing the HOPE 
              Act, which would make college more affordable for 430,000 Americans 
              by increasing Pell Grant awards. But we must do more to make sure 
              that young Americans here and everywhere have a chance at a college 
              diploma. 
             But even beyond 
              those diplomas, you'll need something else to succeed in the years 
              ahead. You'll need to keep that spark that's got this far. The one 
              that will keep you learning the new rules, solving the new mysteries, 
              and discovering the new answers of this brand new century. 
             It is this fundamental 
              character of the American spirit - the desire to move forward, look 
              around the next corner, and reach for the unreachable - that put 
              the first man on the moon, led to a cure for polio, and launched 
              the technological revolution of the nineties. 
             And if you Young 
              Americans keep that spirit alive, I think we'll be just fine. 
             Congratulations 
              to all of you on your achievements, and may God Bless you. Thank 
              you.
