            TOPIC: Our Past, Our Future, Our Vision April 20 , 2005 
            Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum 
            Remarks by Senator Barack Obama 
            Complete Text    Let 
              me congratulate all of those who have helped to make this wonderful 
              vision a reality. 
             But we gather 
              here today not to celebrate a building. We gather to celebrate a 
              man. 
             What is it that 
              makes Lincoln such a seminal figure in our story? How is it that 
              this man, born in the backwoods of Kentucky, with little formal 
              education, homely and awkward, a man given to depression and wracked 
              with self-doubt, might come to represent so much of who we are as 
              a people, and so much of what we aspire to be? 
             Some of it has 
              to do with the trajectory of his life. In his rise from poverty, 
              his self-study and ultimate mastery of language and of law, in his 
              capacity to overcome personal loss and remain determined in the 
              face of repeated defeat - in all of this we see a fundamental element 
              of the American character, a belief that we can constantly remake 
              ourselves to fit our larger dreams. 
             Some of it has 
              to do with the sheer energy of the man, the railsplitter, ax-in-hand, 
              looking out at a frontier of hope and possibility. Lincoln believed 
              deeply in the American spirit of innovation and exploration that 
              accepts no limits to the heights to which our nation might reach. 
             In all of this 
              - the repeated acts of self-creation, the insistence that with sweated 
              brow and calloused hands and focused will we can recast the wilderness 
              of the American landscape and the American heart into something 
              better, something finer - in all of this Lincoln embodies our deepest 
              myths. It is a mythology that drives us still. 
             And yet what separates 
              Lincoln from the other great men has to do with something else. 
              It's an issue of character that speaks to us, of moral resolve. 
              Lincoln was not a perfect man, nor a perfect president. By modern 
              standards, his condemnation of slavery might be considered tentative; 
              his Emancipation Proclamation more a military document than a clarion 
              call for justice. He wasn't immune to political considerations; 
              his temperament could be indecisive and morose. 
             And yet despite 
              these imperfections, despite his fallibility...indeed, perhaps because 
              of a painful self-awareness of his own failings, etched in every 
              crease of his face and reflected in those haunted eyes...because 
              of this essential humanity of his, when it came time to confront 
              the greatest moral challenge this nation has ever faced, Lincoln 
              did not flinch. He did not equivocate or duck or pass the challenge 
              on to future generations. He did not demonize the fathers and sons 
              who did battle on the other side, nor seek to diminish the terrible 
              costs of his war. In the midst of slavery's dark storm and the complexities 
              of governing a house divided, he kept his moral compass pointed 
              firm and true. 
             It serves us then 
              to reflect on whether that element of Lincoln's character, and the 
              American character - that aspect which makes tough choices, and 
              speaks the truth when least convenient, and acts while still admitting 
              doubt - remains with us today. Lincoln once said that "character 
              is like a tree and reputation like its shadow. The shadow is what 
              we think of it; the tree is the real thing." 
             At a time when 
              image all too often trumps substance, when our politics all too 
              often feeds rather than bridges division, when the prospects of 
              a poor youth rising out of poverty seem of no consequence to the 
              powerful, and when we evoke our common God to condemn those who 
              do not think as we do, rather than to seek God's mercy for our own 
              lack of understanding - at such a time it is helpful to remember 
              this man who was the real thing. Lincoln reminds us that our essential 
              greatness is not the shadow of sophistication or popularity, or 
              wealth or power or fleeting celebrity. It is the tree that stands 
              in the face of our doubts and fears and bigotries, and insists we 
              can do better. 
             Today we come 
              to celebrate not a building but a man. And as that man called once 
              upon the better angels of our nature, so is he calling still, across 
              the ages, to summon some measure of that character, his character, 
              in each of us, today.
