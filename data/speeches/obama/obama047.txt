             Hello, this is Senator 
              Barack Obama and today is Thursday, April 27, 2006. 
             A lot of stuff is going 
              on in Washington right now and so what I want to do is provide you 
              some updates on issues that have been discussed on this podcast 
              before but I think are absolutely critical to focus on right now. 
             The first is the issue 
              of Darfur. Many of you heard my previous podcast and have been following 
              this issue in the news. We have a situation in which the Sudanese 
              government in Khartoum has backed militias and gangsters that have 
              slaughtered up to 300,000 innocent Africans. We have a situation 
              in which two million or so people are internally displaced in the 
              Sudan, incredibly vulnerable to potential famine, disease and we're 
              now seeing a spillover effect from Sudan into Chad, where you have 
              another 200,000 refugees. 
             The Bush administration 
              properly labeled this several years ago as an ongoing genocide. 
              The situation has not improved. The world needs to focus its attention 
              on it and America needs to send a message to its leadership that 
              this is a top priority. We need to get a UN protection force in 
              there to protect the two million people who are internally displaced. 
              We've got to start peace talks between the rebels and the Khartoum 
              government that provides some basis for a long-term settlement of 
              disputes there and we have to make sure that humanitarian aid continues. 
             In the interest of all 
              these issues stopping the genocide in Darfur there are going to 
              be a couple of activities that I hope some of you can attend. Number 
              one: this Sunday, we are going to be holding a rally to save Darfur 
              in the United States Capitol, in Washington. That will be taking 
              place from two o'clock until four o'clock in front of the United 
              States Capitol, between 3rd Streets and 4th Streets. If you are 
              interested in participating, you should get on the website savedarfur.org. 
              That will give you all the details. I'm going to be there and Elie 
              Wiesel, the author and Holocaust survivor, is going to be there. 
              We're going to have George Clooney there as well as a number of 
              people who have been active on this issue. I hope we can have a 
              strong turnout that sends a message that genocide is not acceptable 
              not only in the United States but the United Nations and the international 
              community have to rally behind these folks. There is also going 
              to be a Chicago rally on May 1, 2006 at 4:30 p.m. in the Federal 
              Plaza in Dearborn and Adams and so for my Chicago listeners or Illinois 
              listeners you can show your support in that fashion if you can't 
              make the rally in Washington. 
             The second issue I just 
              want to give you an update on is immigration. I met with the President 
              and some of my other colleagues in the West Wing this week to discuss 
              with him where we are on immigration reform. Obviously this is an 
              issue of great passion. It is an issue that has brought together 
              diverse coalitions of people who recognize that we have to change 
              how we approach immigration. 
             I've been one of they key 
              negotiators in the Senate for a comprehensive immigration reform 
              bill that includes something that everybody agrees to: we have to 
              improve border security. It also includes internal enforcement, 
              making sure that employers actually are checking a verifiable, tamper-proof 
              ID card to show that a worker is legally inside the United States 
              to work. But three, that we're providing a pathway to citizenship 
              for the 11 to 12 million people who are already in the United States. 
             There's been a lot of talk 
              on cable and talk radio about amnesty and how we shouldn't allow 
              lawbreakers to become U.S. citizens. The fact of the matter is that 
              these 11 to 12 million people came here for the same reason that 
              every immigrant group has come here and that's a search for a better 
              life for their children. They didn't do it through the regular processes 
              and they should be penalized for that and as a consequence what 
              we've been setting up is an eleven-year process that gives people 
              an opportunity for citizenship but still puts them in the back of 
              the line behind those who are applying legally for citizenship. 
             Having said that, it is 
              important for us to bring these folks out of the shadows to ensure 
              that they are subject to the same protections that any legal worker 
              has in this country because if we leave them in the shadows, not 
              only are they vulnerable, not only are they living in fear, many 
              of these people are our neighbors, our friends, people who are looking 
              after our children, doing work across the country, some of the dirtiest 
              and toughest work without complaint. But if we don't do anything, 
              these are also folks who can, because of their tenuous status, undercut 
              the wages of U.S. workers. If they're not subject to minimum wage 
              laws, if they're not subject to worker safety laws, if they can't 
              unionize, than naturally their wages are going to be depressed and 
              that means that there is an incentive for employers to hire these 
              workers instead of U.S. citizens. If, on the other hand, they're 
              out of the shadows, they have the same rights and obligations as 
              every other worker who is in this country legally, than they are 
              on even footing in terms of employers making hiring decisions. So 
              don't get caught up in the false rhetoric about amnesty. What we 
              are talking about is an earned pathway to citizenship. Over the 
              course of eleven years, they would have to pay a fine, they would 
              have to learn English, they would have to pay back taxes and they 
              would be behind those who applied here legally. So, they wouldn't' 
              be rewarded for their illegal behavior but we would recognize that 
              our future as a country involves absorbing these people who are 
              already here so we wouldn't have an entire class of second-class 
              citizens. 
             The third point I want 
              to make is that I know gas prices are high out there. There's been 
              a lot of talk by the both the White House and Congress about how 
              we're going to bring gas prices down. I want to tell people the 
              truth and that is that there aren't a lot of short-term solutions 
              to this problem. We have some bills in the Senate that are calling 
              for the taxing of the windfall profits of the big oil companies 
              who are making out like bandits. I will vote "aye" on 
              a bill like that if it comes through the Senate. I've been active 
              along with other Democrats in pushing to make sure that the Federal 
              Trade Commission is investigating any kind of price-gauging that's 
              taking place in gas stations around the country. But the bottom 
              line is that the United States, which has about 3 percent of the 
              oil reserves in the world consumes 25 percent of the oil, and we're 
              not going to be able to pump our way out of this problem and even 
              if Exxon and Mobile decided they weren't going to make any profits, 
              we'd still have problems because the world's oil market has reached 
              $75 a barrel this week. So we are going to have to think about how 
              we are going to wean ourselves off our dependence on oil. That's 
              a national security imperative because right now we are financing 
              both sides of the war on terrorism by sending billions of dollars 
              to some of the most hostile countries on Earth. It is an economic 
              problem; it makes us extraordinarily vulnerable every time we see 
              price shocks like this and that pressure is just going to continue 
              as China and India grow and scramble for resources. Finally, it's 
              a major contributor to global warming. It's helping us along the 
              path that could lead to an environmental catastrophe that could 
              have an adverse impact for our children and our grandchildren. 
             
              I've put together a series of speeches and proposals that are on 
              my website. I would urge everybody to take a look at them; I won't 
              reiterate them now, but a lot of it focuses on increasing fuel efficiency 
              standards and shifting to bio-diesel. I just want everybody to remember 
              as they are putting that $3 a gallon gas in their SUVs that our 
              long-term answer is getting serious about a new energy policy. We 
              have to start making those plans now in a serious way and not just 
              resort to cheap rhetoric whenever the gas prices go up. 
             I hope that I see some 
              of you at the rallies, either in Washington or in Chicago, about 
              Darfur. I appreciate you listening. Bye-bye.
