              Hello, this is Senator 
              Barack Obama and today is Thursday, May 4th, 2006. 
             On Monday, I traveled from 
              D.C. to Chicago to witness a monumental event. There were 400,000 
              people marching on behalf of comprehensive immigration reform in 
              this country. There were rallies all across the country but Chicago 
              was one of the largest. I had the opportunity to speak to the people 
              who were gathering at Union Park before they marched over to Grant 
              Park. Four-hundred thousand people, mostly of Mexican origin, but 
              large numbers of people from other countries - Nigerians and Pakistanis 
              and Indians and Filipinos - people who've come to this country for 
              the same reason that immigrants have been drawn to this country 
              for generations: the notion that they can pursue and better life 
              for themselves but, most importantly, for their children, if they 
              work hard and apply themselves. 
             I think most of you are 
              familiar with the issues that have surrounded immigration. They've 
              gotten a lot of attention recently. We have a system of legal immigration 
              in which people are drawn through the normal processes and they 
              apply for legal residency and ultimately get naturalized as citizens 
              if they so choose. The controversy right now surrounds undocumented 
              workers - people who came here illegally, most of them crossing 
              the border between Mexico and the United States. It's estimated 
              at this point that we probably have 11 to 12 million undocumented 
              workers around the country. Most of them are employed in low-wage 
              backbreaking work in agricultural sectors, in packing plants, in 
              restaurants, in construction. Obviously, the country feels ambivalent 
              about this influx. 
             On the one hand, I think 
              many of us (including myself) believe that these people are doing 
              what any of us would do if we had an opportunity for a better life 
              for our kids. They take the risk of coming here; many of them are 
              extraordinarily impoverished and would not likely be able to get 
              to the United States through the limited number of visas that are 
              currently issued. 
             On the other hand, we are 
              a nation of laws and these people did come here outside of the law. 
              Economists debate what kind of effect undocumented workers have 
              in this country. There's no doubt that in many areas, like the agricultural 
              sector, these immigrants are doing work that Americans would not 
              do, at least at the wages that are paid. There are other circumstances 
              in which it is clear that employers are importing these workers 
              simply because they don't want to pay the living wages that Americans 
              demand. There is no doubt that if construction companies were willing 
              to pay more that they would see more U.S. workers applying for those 
              jobs. It does appear that undocumented workers have a somewhat adverse 
              effect in depressing the wages of low-skill workers, which is why 
              in the African-American community, for example, there is some nervousness 
              of about the number of undocumented workers that are coming into 
              this country and whether they are systematically replacing or pushing 
              out low-skill, low-wage black workers. 
             Having said all that, I 
              think we need to recognize that if we are going to uphold the traditions 
              of this country as a nation of immigrants, than we are going to 
              have to deal with this issue in a way that reflects common sense 
              and compassion. 
             The House of Representatives 
              passed a bill that was extraordinarily punitive. It talked about 
              border security and it made any undocumented worker in this country 
              a felon; it also made people who potentially helped undocumented 
              workers, for example, providing housing assistance or providing 
              a domestic violence shelter potentially subject to a felony conviction. 
             It's that draconian measure 
              that passed in the House that prompted these marches, but what started 
              as a march of fear on the part of many undocumented workers, I think, 
              has become a march for hope. People are hoping that they have an 
              opportunity to legalize themselves in some fashion. 
             In the United States Senate 
              there has been a bipartisan group, including myself, Ted Kennedy, 
              John McCain, Chuck Hagel, Mel Martinez, Ken Salazar, Lindsey Graham 
              and a number of others who've been trying to negotiate a comprehensive 
              package that would include stronger border security, making sure 
              that employers actually verify employment status through a tamper-proof 
              employee-verification card, and creation of a pathway to citizenship 
              - earned citizenship - for the 11 to 12 million people that are 
              already here. The idea would be that those people, over the course 
              of eleven years could earn their way to citizenship by paying a 
              fine, paying their back taxes (if they owe any), staying out of 
              trouble, learning English and so on. The opponents of this kind 
              of proposal call this amnesty and they hearken back to what happened 
              in 1986 when, in fact, undocumented workers were provided amnesty. 
              There was supposed to be a grand bargain where in exchange for such 
              amnesty there was going to be serious border security and employer 
              sanctions on those who had hired undocumented workers. That never 
              really happened. And so people who are opposed to the Senate bill 
              believe that the best strategy is not to provide amnesty to these 
              undocumented workers but simply shut off the possibility that they 
              can be hired, perhaps deport them where they can be rounded up and 
              build either a virtual wall or a literal wall along the Mexican 
              and United States borders. That kind of approach just isn't realistic. 
              We're not going to deport 11 to 12 million people; many of them 
              have been here for many years, many of them have strong roots, many 
              of them have children who were born here and are therefore United 
              States citizens. It's hard to imagine that we want to live in a 
              country where we would have police and immigration officials coming 
              into people's homes and taking away the father of a family, sending 
              him back to Mexico, leaving a mother and child behind. 
             This is going to be an 
              emotional issue. It's not going to go away any time soon. I think 
              what we saw in those marches is the face of a new America. America 
              is changing and we can't be threatened by it. We have to understand 
              that we are going to be better off united than divided. 
             When I spoke to folks at 
              this rally I insisted that for those undocumented workers who hope 
              some way to have a pathway to citizenship, they have to understand 
              that citizenship involves a common language, a common faith in the 
              country, common commitments and a common sense of purpose, fealty 
              to a common flag. I think there are times in these marches were 
              you have seen Mexican flags; there has been controversy around a 
              Spanish national anthem. I think that is not helpful because it 
              indicates that somehow the traditional pattern of immigrants assimilating 
              to a broader American culture is not what these marchers are seeking. 
              I think they have to seek that because that is the essence of this 
              country - that in diversity we come together as one. 
             On the other hand, to those 
              who are fearful of these immigrants, in some cases because they 
              have come to represent a loss of control for the country and its 
              borders, I would just say to them that we can't have a country in 
              which you have a servant class that is picking our lettuce or plucking 
              our chickens or looking after our children or mowing our lawns but 
              who never have the full rights and obligations of citizenship. That's 
              just not the kind of country that I want to have my children grow 
              up in and my hope is that over the coming months we can come up 
              with the kind of comprehensive, thoughtful legislation that I think 
              the Senate bill reflects and we can have strong border security, 
              we can have employers do the right thing by hiring those who are 
              here legally in some fashion, but that we also provide all those 
              families, children, elderly people and teenagers that I saw in that 
              amazing march on Monday the opportunity to be full members of the 
              American community. 
             Anyway, I will keep you 
              guys posted on this important issue and I look forward to talking 
              to you next week. Bye-bye.
