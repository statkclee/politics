            TOPIC: Civil Rights 
            July 20, 2006 
            Remarks of Senator Barack Obama 
            In Support of H.R. 9, the Voting Rights Act 
            Complete Text  
             
              Mr. President, I rise 
              today, both humbled and honored by the opportunity to express my 
              support for renewal of the expiring provisions of the Voting Rights 
              Act of 1965. 
             I want to thank the many 
              people inside and outside of Congress who worked so hard over the 
              past year to get us here. We owe a debt of gratitude to the leadership 
              on both sides of the aisle, and we owe special thanks to Chairmen 
              Sensenbrenner and Specter, Ranking Members Conyers and Leahy, and 
              Rep. Mel Watt. Without their work and dedication - and the support 
              of voting rights advocates around the country - I doubt this bill 
              would have come before us so soon. 
             And I want to thank both 
              chambers, and both sides of the aisle, for getting this done with 
              the same broad support that drove the original Act 40 years ago. 
              At a time when Americans are frustrated with the partisan bickering 
              that too often stalls our work, the refreshing display of bipartisanship 
              we are seeing today reflects our collective belief in the success 
              of the Act and reminds us of how effective we can be when we work 
              together. 
             Nobody can deny that we've 
              come a long way since 1965. 
             Look at registration numbers. 
              Only two years after passage of the original Act, registration numbers 
              for minority voters in some states doubled. Soon after, not a single 
              state covered by the Voting Rights Act had registered less than 
              half of its minority voting-age population. 
             Look at the influence of 
              African-American elected officials at all levels of government. 
              There are African-American members of Congress. Since 2001, our 
              nation's top diplomat has been an African-American. 
             In fact, most of America's 
              elected African-American officials come from the states covered 
              by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act - states like Mississippi 
              and Alabama and Louisiana and Georgia. 
             But to me, the most striking 
              evidence of our progress can be found right across this building, 
              in my dear friend, Congressman John Lewis, who was on the front 
              lines of the civil rights movement, risking life and limb for freedom. 
              And on March 7, 1965, he led 600 peaceful protestors demanding the 
              right to vote across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. 
             I've often thought about 
              the people on the Edmund Pettus Bridge that day. Not only John Lewis 
              and Hosea Williams leading the march, but the hundreds of everyday 
              Americans who left their homes and their churches to join it. Blacks 
              and whites, teenagers and children, teachers and bankers and shopkeepers 
              - a beloved community of God's children ready to stand for freedom. 
             And I wonder, where did 
              they find that kind of courage? When you're facing row after row 
              of state troopers on horseback armed with billy clubs and tear gas...when 
              they're coming toward you spewing hatred and violence, how do you 
              simply stop, kneel down, and pray to the Lord for salvation? 
             But the most amazing thing 
              of all is that after that day - after John Lewis was beaten within 
              an inch of his life, after people's heads were gashed open and their 
              eyes were burned and they watched their children's innocence literally 
              beaten out of them...after all that, they went back to march again. 
             They marched again. They 
              crossed the bridge. They awakened a nation's conscience, and not 
              five months later, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into 
              law. And it was reauthorized in 1970, 1975, and 1982. 
             Now, in 2006, John Lewis, 
              the physical scars from those marches still visible, is an original 
              cosponsor of the fourth reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, 
              and he was joined last week by 389 of his House colleagues in voting 
              for its passage. 
             There are some who argue 
              the Act is no longer needed, that the protections of Section 5's 
              "pre-clearance" requirement - a requirement that ensures 
              certain states are upholding the right to vote - are targeting the 
              wrong states. But the evidence refutes that notion. Of the 1,100 
              objections issued by the Department of Justice since 1965, 56% occurred 
              since the last reauthorization in 1982. So, despite the progress 
              these states have made in upholding the right to vote, it's clear 
              that problems still exist. 
             Others have argued against 
              renewing Section 203's protection of language minorities. Unfortunately, 
              these arguments have been tied to the debate over immigration and 
              muddle a non-controversial issue - protecting the right to vote 
              - with one of today's most contentious debates. 
             But let's remember: you 
              can't request language assistance if you're not a voter, and you 
              can't be a voter if you're not a citizen. And while voters, as citizens, 
              must be proficient in English, many are simply more confident that 
              they can cast ballots printed in their native languages without 
              making errors. 
             A representative of the 
              Southwestern Voter Registration Project is quoted as saying: "Citizens 
              who prefer Spanish registration cards do so because they feel more 
              connected to the process; they also feel they trust the process 
              more when they understand it." These sentiments - connection 
              to and trust in our democratic process - are exactly what we want 
              from our voting rights legislation. 
             Our challenges don't end 
              at reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act either. We have to prevent 
              the problems we've seen in recent elections from happening again. 
              We've seen political operatives purge voters from registration rolls 
              for no legitimate reason, prevent eligible ex-felons from casting 
              ballots, distribute polling equipment unevenly, and deceive voters 
              about the time, location and rules of elections. Unfortunately, 
              these efforts have been directed primarily at minorities, the disabled, 
              low-income individuals, and other historically disenfranchised groups. 
             The Help America Vote Act 
              was a big step in the right direction, but we need to do more. We 
              need to fully fund HAVA. We need to enforce critical requirements 
              like statewide registration databases. We need to make sure polling 
              equipment is distributed equitably and that the equipment works. 
              And we need to work on getting more people to the polls on election 
              day. 
             We need to make sure that 
              minority voters are not the subject of deplorable intimidation tactics 
              when they do get to the polls. In 2004, Native American voters in 
              South Dakota were confronted by men posing as law enforcement. These 
              hired intimidators joked about jail time for ballot missteps, and 
              followed voters to their cars to record their license plate numbers. 
             In Lake County, Ohio, some 
              voters received a memo on bogus Board of Elections letterhead informing 
              voters who registered through Democratic and NAACP drives that they 
              could not vote. 
             In Wisconsin, a flier purporting 
              to be from the "Milwaukee Black Voters League" was circulated 
              in predominantly African-American neighborhoods with the following 
              message: "If you've already voted in any election this year, 
              you can't vote in the presidential election. If you violate any 
              of these laws, you can get ten years in prison and your children 
              will get taken away from you." 
             So, we have much more work 
              to do. This occasion is cause for celebration, but it's also an 
              opportunity to renew our commitment to voting rights. As Congressman 
              Lewis said last week: "It's clear that we have come a great 
              distance, but we still have a great distance to go." 
             The memory of Selma still 
              lives on in the spirit of the Voting Rights Act. Since that day, 
              the Voting Rights Act has been a critical tool in ensuring that 
              all Americans not only have the right to vote, but the right to 
              have their vote counted. Those of us concerned about protecting 
              those rights can't afford to sit on our laurels upon reauthorization 
              of this bill. We must take advantage of this rare united front and 
              continue the fight to ensure unimpeded access to the polls for all 
              Americans. In other words, we need to take the spirit that existed 
              on that bridge, and we have to spread it across this country. 
             Two weeks after the first 
              march was turned back, Dr. King told a gathering of organizers and 
              activists and community members that they should not despair because 
              the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice. 
              That's because of the work that each of us do to bend it towards 
              justice. It's because of people like John Lewis and Fannie Lou Hamer 
              and Coretta Scott King and Rosa Parks, all the giants upon whose 
              shoulders we stand that we are the beneficiaries of that arc bending 
              towards justice. 
             That's why I stand here 
              today. I would not be in the United States Senate had it not been 
              for the efforts and courage of so many parents and grandparents 
              and ordinary people who were willing to reach up and bend that arc 
              in the direction of justice. I hope we continue to see that spirit 
              live on, not just during this debate, but throughout all our work 
              here in the Senate. Thank you.
