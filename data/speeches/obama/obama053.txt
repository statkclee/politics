                Obama's Floor Statement on Meals Amendment 
             
         
            TOPIC: Ethics & Lobbying Reform 
            March 8, 2006 
            Senator Obama's Floor Statement on Meals Amendment 
            Complete Text  
             
              I rise today in support of Senator Feingold's amendment 
              to eliminate a loophole in this bill that would still allow members 
              and staff to receive free meals from lobbyists up to $50 in value. 
             Now, of all the ethics reforms we take up this week, 
              this should be an easy one. Because I can't think of a single reason 
              in the world why we shouldn't be paying for our own lunches in Washington. 
             In cities and towns all across America, people pay 
              for their own lunches and their own dinners. People who make far 
              less than we do. People who can't afford their medical bills or 
              their mortgages or their kids' tuition. 
             You ask them if they think that the people they 
              send to Congress should be able to rack up a $50 meal on a lobbyists' 
              dime. You ask them if they think we should be able feast on free 
              steak dinners at fancy restaurants while they're working two jobs 
              just to put food on their table. 
             I don't think we need to put a poll in the field 
              to find out the answer to that one. 
             Now, in no way do I think that any of my colleagues 
              or staffers would exchange votes for meals. But that's not the point. 
              It's not just the meal that's the problem, it's the perception. 
              It's the access that meal gets you. 
             In the current Washington culture, lobbyists are 
              expected to pick up the tab when they meet with members or staff. 
              It is simply understood by all sides that the best way to get face 
              time with a member or staffer in order to express your ideas on 
              legislation is to buy them a meal. 
             But you don't see many members eating $50 meals 
              with constituents who are in town to talk about the issues on their 
              mind or with policy experts who are discussing the latest economic 
              theories. Most of these meals are with high-priced lobbyists who 
              are advocating on behalf of a specific interest. The appearance 
              is that they can afford the access, so they get it. 
             This culture has been around for some time, but 
              it wasn't always that way. One of the first reforms that Newt Gingrich 
              passed when the Republicans took control of the House in 1995 was 
              an absolute gift and meal ban. During the debates on this subject, 
              then-Speaker Gingrich said, "The simplest, the cleanest and 
              the clearest standard is to say, 'No gifts'. There's no way around 
              it. You didn't get the gift before you were elected. You ain't gonna 
              get the gift after you leave." 
             Newt Gingrich was right. He was right then, and 
              he's right today. The only reason members and staff are receiving 
              these free meals is because of who they are. That's not the way 
              we should be doing business in this town - and that's why we should 
              bring the ban back. 
             This isn't about preventing us from interacting 
              with lobbyists who have legitimate business to discuss, and it isn't 
              about preventing staff from getting the information they need to 
              help us pass better policy. We can still do all of this if the ban 
              passes, and we can even do it over lunch or dinner. 
             All we're asking here is to take out your wallet, 
              pull out your credit card, and pay for your own meal. Everyone else 
              in this country does it - we can do it too. 
             The American people will be watching and reading 
              about what we do here today. Eating expensive steak dinners is not 
              why all of us decided to pursue public service, and it's certainly 
              not why the American people elected us to represent them in Washington. 
              Our constituents expect more from us, and this is our opportunity 
              to live up to those expectations. That's why I will be voting for 
              Senator Feingold's amendment and that's why I expect my colleagues 
              to do the same. 
             I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.
