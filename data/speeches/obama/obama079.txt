                HURRICANE KATRINA RELIEF EFFORTS  
             
         
            TOPIC: Katrina & Gulf Recovery 
            September 6, 2005 
            Statement of Senator Barack Obama 
            Hurricane Katrina Relief Efforts 
            Complete Text    
            I just got back from a trip to Houston with former Presidents Clinton 
            and Bush. And as we wandered through the crowd, we heard in very intimate 
            terms the heart-wrenching stories that all of us have witnessed from 
            a distance over the past several days: mothers separated from babies, 
            adults mourning the loss of elderly parents, descriptions of the heat 
            and filth and fear of the Superdome and the Convention Center. There 
            was an overriding sense of relief, for the officials in Houston have 
            done an outstanding job of creating a clean and stable place for these 
            families in the short-term. But a conversation I had with one woman 
            captured the realities that are settling into these families as they 
            face the future.  
             She told me "We 
              had nothing before the hurricane. Now we got less than nothing." 
             We had nothing 
              before the hurricane. Now we got less than nothing. 
             In the coming 
              weeks, as the images of the immediate crisis fade and this chamber 
              becomes consumed with other matters, we will be hearing a lot about 
              lessons learned and steps to be taken. I will be among those voices 
              calling for action. 
             In the most immediate 
              term, we will have to assure that the efforts at evacuating families 
              from the affected states proceeds - that these Americans are fed, 
              clothed, housed, and provided with the immediate care and medicine 
              that they need. We're going to have to make sure that we cut through 
              red tape. I can say from personal experience how frustrating, how 
              unconscionable it is, that it has been so difficult to get medical 
              supplies to those in need quickly enough. We should make certain 
              that any impediments that may continue to exist in preventing relief 
              efforts from moving rapidly are eliminated. 
             Once we stabilize 
              the situation, this country will face an enormous challenge in providing 
              stability for displaced families over the months and years that 
              it will take to rebuild. Already, the state of Illinois has committed 
              to accepting 10,000 families that are displaced. There are stories 
              in Illinois as there are everywhere of churches, mosques, synagogues 
              and individual families welcoming people with open arms and no strings 
              attached. Indeed, if there's any bright light that has come out 
              of this disaster, it's the degree to which ordinary Americans have 
              responded with speed and determination even as their government 
              has responded with unconscionable ineptitude. 
             Which brings me 
              to the next point. Once the situation is stable, once families are 
              settled - at least for the short term - once children are reunited 
              with their parents and enrolled in schools and the wounds have healed, 
              we're gonna have to do some hard thinking about how we could have 
              failed our fellow citizens so badly, and how we will prevent such 
              a failure from ever occurring again. 
             It is not politics 
              to insist that we have an independent commission to examine these 
              issues. Indeed, one of the heartening things about this crisis has 
              been the degree to which the outrage has come from across the political 
              spectrum; across races; across incomes. The degree to which the 
              American people sense that we can and must do better, and a recognition 
              that if we cannot cope with a crisis that has been predicted for 
              decades - a crisis in which we're given four or five days notice 
              - how can we ever hope to respond to a serious terrorist attack 
              in a major American city in which there is no notice, and in which 
              the death toll and panic and disruptions may be far greater? 
             Which brings me 
              to my final point. There's been much attention in the press about 
              the fact that those who were left behind in New Orleans were disproportionately 
              poor and African American. I've said publicly that I do not subscribe 
              to the notion that the painfully slow response of FEMA and the Department 
              of Homeland Security was racially-based. The ineptitude was colorblind. 
             But what must 
              be said is that whoever was in charge of planning and preparing 
              for the worst case scenario appeared to assume that every American 
              has the capacity to load up their family in an SUV, fill it up with 
              $100 worth of gasoline, stick some bottled water in the trunk, and 
              use a credit card to check in to a hotel on safe ground. I see no 
              evidence of active malice, but I see a continuation of passive indifference 
              on the part of our government towards the least of these. 
             And so I hope 
              that out of this crisis we all begin to reflect - Democrat and Republican 
              - on not only our individual responsibilities to ourselves and our 
              families, but to our mutual responsibilities to our fellow Americans. 
              I hope we realize that the people of New Orleans weren't just abandoned 
              during the Hurricane. They were abandoned long ago - to murder and 
              mayhem in their streets; to substandard schools; to dilapidated 
              housing; to inadequate health care; to a pervasive sense of hopelessness. 
             That is the deeper 
              shame of this past week - that it has taken a crisis like this one 
              to awaken us to the great divide that continues to fester in our 
              midst. That's what all Americans are truly ashamed about, and the 
              fact that we're ashamed about it is a good sign. The fact that all 
              of us - black, white, rich, poor, Republican, Democrat - don't like 
              to see such a reflection of this country we love, tells me that 
              the American people have better instincts and a broader heart than 
              our current politics would indicate. 
             We had nothing 
              before the Hurricane. Now we have even less. 
             I hope that we 
              all take the time to ponder the truth of that message.
