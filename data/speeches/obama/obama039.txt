            TOPIC: Foreign Policy & Defense 
            May 25, 2006 
            Senator Barack Obama 
            Floor Statement General Michael Hayden Nomination 
            Complete Text  
             
              Mr. President. 
             Let me start by saying 
              that General Hayden is extremely well qualified for this position. 
              Having previously served as head of the National Security Agency 
              and as Deputy Director of National Intelligence under John Negroponte, 
              he has thirty years of experience in intelligence and national security 
              matters. And he was nearly universally praised during his confirmation 
              to deputy DNI. 
             Unfortunately, General 
              Hayden is being nominated under troubling circumstances as the architect 
              and chief defender of a program of wiretapping and collection of 
              phone records outside of FISA oversight. This is a program that 
              is still accountable to no one and no law. 
             Now, there is no one in 
              this Congress who doesn't want President Bush to have every tool 
              at his disposal to prevent terrorist attacks - including the use 
              of a surveillance program. Every single American - Democrat and 
              Republican -- who remembers the images of falling towers and needless 
              death would gladly support increased surveillance to prevent another 
              attack. 
             But over the last six months, 
              Americans have learned that the National Security Agency has been 
              spying on Americans without judicial approval. We learned about 
              this not from the Administration, but from the New York Times and 
              USA Today. Every time a revelation came out, President Bush refused 
              to answer questions from Congress. 
             This is part of a general 
              stance by this Administration that it can operate with no restraints. 
              President Bush is interpreting Article II of the Constitution as 
              giving him authority with no bounds. The Attorney General and a 
              hand full of scholars agree with this view, and I don't doubt the 
              sincerity with which the President and his lawyers believe this 
              constitutional interpretation. However, the overwhelming weight 
              of legal authority is against the President on his unbounded authority 
              without any checks or balances. This is not how our Constitution 
              is designed. 
             We don't expect the President 
              to give the American people every detail about a classified surveillance 
              program. But we do expect him to place such a program within the 
              rule of law, and to allow members of the other two coequal branches 
              of government - Congress and the Judiciary - to have the ability 
              to monitor and oversee such a program. Our Constitution and our 
              right to privacy as Americans require as much. 
             Unfortunately, we were 
              never given the chance to make that examination. Time and again, 
              President Bush has refused to come clean to Congress. Why was it 
              that 14 of 16 members of the Intelligence Committee were kept in 
              the dark for four and a half years? The only reason that some Senators 
              are now being briefed is because the story was made public. Without 
              that information it is impossible to make the decisions that allow 
              us to balance the need to fight terrorism while still upholding 
              the rule of law and privacy protections that make this country great. 
             Every democracy is tested 
              when it is faced with a serious threat. As a nation, we have to 
              find the right balance between privacy and security, between executive 
              authority to face threats and uncontrolled power. What protects 
              us, and what distinguishes us, are the procedures we put in place 
              to protect that balance, namely judicial warrants and congressional 
              review. These aren't arbitrary ideas. These are the concrete safeguards 
              that make sure that surveillance hasn't gone too far. That someone 
              is watching the watchers. 
             The exact details of these 
              safeguards are not etched in stone. They can be reevaluated from 
              time to time. The last time we had a major overhaul of the intelligence 
              apparatus was 30 years ago in the aftermath of Watergate. After 
              those dark days, the White House worked in a collaborative way with 
              Congress through the Church Committee to study the issue, revise 
              intelligence laws and set up a system of checks and balances. It 
              worked then and it could work now. But unfortunately, this Administration 
              has made no effort to reach out to Congress and tailor FISA. 
             I have no doubt that General 
              Hayden will be confirmed. But I am going to reluctantly vote against 
              him to send a signal to this Administration that even in these circumstances 
              President Bush is not above the law. I am voting against Hayden 
              in the hope that he will be more humble before the great weight 
              of responsibility that he has, not only to protect our lives, but 
              to protect our democracy. 
             Americans fought a Revolution 
              in part over the right to be free from unreasonable searches - to 
              ensure that our government couldn't come knocking in the middle 
              of the night for no reason. We need to find a way forward to make 
              sure that we can stop terrorists while protecting the privacy, and 
              liberty, of innocent Americans. We have to find a way to give the 
              President the power he needs to protect us, while making sure he 
              doesn't abuse that power. It is possible to do that. We have done 
              it before, we could do it again.
