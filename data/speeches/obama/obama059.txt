                Obama's Floor Statement on the Hurricane Katrina Child Assistance 
                Amendment 
             
         
            TOPIC: Katrina & Gulf Recovery 
            February 1, 2006 
            Senator Obama's Floor Statement 
            Hurricane Katrina Child Assistance Amendment 
            Complete Text    
            Mr. President, I rise to speak about an amendment to the Tax Reconciliation 
            bill that I intend to offer at the appropriate time.  
             The Amendment 
              achieves two goals. First, it helps keep a promise the President 
              made to rebuild the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. 
              Second, in a $70 billion bill laden with tax cuts for the wealthy 
              and well-connected, it sets aside less than 1 percent for the neediest 
              in our society. 
             Two weeks after 
              Katrina made landfall, President Bush stood in the ruins of New 
              Orleans and vowed to "do what it takes" to help the region 
              recover. He also acknowledged the terrifying images of abject poverty 
              that struck Americans on their TV screens and said, "We have 
              a duty to confront this poverty with bold action." Five months 
              later, the President's timid actions have not matched his bold rhetoric. 
              He has not lived up to his promises. 
             My amendment uses 
              a cost-effective and proven tool in our tax code--the Child Tax 
              Credit--to extend aid to low-income working families affected by 
              Hurricane Katrina. 
             Enacted in 1997, 
              the Child Credit allows families with qualifying children to receive 
              a credit of $1,000 per child against their federal income tax. Unfortunately, 
              the credit is skewed so that many families who need it the most 
              can't get it. 
             Under current 
              law, families that earn less than $11,000 get no benefit from the 
              refundable child credit. That means that a child is left out of 
              the credit even if her parent works full time at minimum wage, which 
              has not increased since 1997. And the child doesn't get the full 
              benefit of the $1000 credit until her parent earns close to $18,000, 
              or even more if the child has siblings. 
             What's worse: 
              if her parents' incomes stagnate, are disrupted for any reason, 
              or the economy stalls and work hours or wages are reduced, the value 
              of the credit drops or even disappears. Under current law, almost 
              17 million children get less than the full credit. 
             We all know what 
              happened to the families on the Gulf Coast due to Hurricane Katrina, 
              and it will be a long time before these families can rebuild their 
              lives. Many of the families in the affected states were evacuated 
              to other areas, and many of them cannot even afford to go back. 
              And the federal response so far has been inadequate to get these 
              families effectively back on their feet. 
             We need to do 
              better. At a time when we are debating $70 billion of tax breaks, 
              many of which will benefit those who need the least help, it is 
              critical that we remember the worst off and the most vulnerable 
              members of our society. 
             When I went to 
              Houston after the Hurricane, I met an evacuee from New Orleans who 
              said to me: "we had nothing before the hurricane, and now we've 
              got less than nothing." Life was hard for many families even 
              before Katrina hit. In Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, for 
              example, more than 900,000 children under 17 years old were so poor 
              that they got no child tax credit or only a partial credit. These 
              states had among the highest rates of children too poor to get the 
              full credit. In fact, more than 1/3 of the children in Mississippi 
              and Louisiana didn't get the full benefit of the child tax credit. 
             This amendment, 
              at a cost of less than 1 percent of the overall Tax Reconciliation 
              bill, will provide necessary assistance to many of these families. 
              The amendment eliminates the income threshold that excluded all 
              children in families with less than $11,000 of income. 
             My amendment sends 
              a simple message: if you work, your kids get a benefit. It provides 
              a partial credit starting with the first dollar of a parent's income 
              for families who lived in the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina. 
             The amendment 
              is simple: it says that the children of low-income working parents 
              affected by Hurricane Katrina will no longer be denied the child 
              credit. You work, your kids get a benefit. If you don't work, no 
              benefit. And if you want the full benefit, you have to earn at least 
              $10,000, which is just about the income of a full time job at minimum 
              wage. 
             That's a common 
              sense way to support families with children, especially families 
              that have experienced the huge cost - psychological and financial 
              - of a natural disaster. 
             My amendment is 
              also narrowly tailored and fiscally responsible. It is aimed at 
              families affected by the Hurricanes, and it provides short-term 
              support, expiring in 2008. 
             With this amendment, 
              hundreds of thousands of this country's most disadvantaged children 
              will see an increase in their credit. Katrina offered us a window 
              into America's poverty. Let's not let that window close without 
              doing something to provide a chance for America's children to rebuild 
              their lives with dignity, hope, and opportunity. 
             I yield the floor.
