            Senator Obama's Floor Speech 
            Opposition to the Amendment Requiring a Photo ID 
            Complete Text  
             
             Thank you very much, Mr. 
              President. Let me just echo Senator Kennedy's strong opposition 
              to the amendment that is offered by the Senator from Kentucky. 
             There is no more fundamental 
              right accorded to United States citizens by the Constitution than 
              the right to vote. The unimpeded exercise of this right is essential 
              to the functioning of our democracy. Unfortunately, history has 
              not been kind to certain citizens in protecting their ability to 
              exercise this right. 
             For a large part of our 
              nation's history, racial minorities have been prevented from voting 
              because of barriers such as literacy tests, poll taxes and property 
              requirements. We've come a long way. That was clear a few weeks 
              ago when Democrats and Republicans, members of the Senate and the 
              House stood on the Capitol steps to announce the introduction of 
              a bill to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act. That rare and refreshing 
              display of bipartisanship reflects our collective belief that more 
              needs to be done to remove barriers to voting. 
             Right now, the Senate is 
              finishing a historic debate about immigration reform. It's been 
              a difficult discussion, occasionally contentious. It's required 
              bipartisan cooperation. After several weeks and many, many amendments, 
              we're less than an hour away from voting for cloture. Considering 
              our progress and the delicate balance we're trying to maintain, 
              this amendment could not come at a worse time. 
             Let's be clear. This is 
              a national voter ID law. This is a national voter ID law that breaks 
              the careful compromise struck by a 50-50 Senate four years ago. 
              It would be the most restrictive voter ID ever enacted, one that 
              could quite literally result in millions of disenfranchised voters 
              and utter chaos at the state level. 
             Now, I recognize there's 
              a certain simplistic appeal to this amendment. Why shouldn't we 
              require people to have a voter ID card when they vote? Don't we 
              want to make sure voters are who they claim to be? And shouldn't 
              we make sure non-citizens are casting ballots to change the outcome 
              of elections? 
             There are two problems 
              with the argument: number one, there's been no showing that there's 
              any significant problem with voter fraud in the 50 states. There 
              certainly is no showing that non-citizens are rushing to try to 
              vote: this is a solution in search of a problem. 
             The second problem is that 
              historically disenfranchised groups - minorities, the poor, the 
              elderly and the disabled - are most affected by photo ID laws. Let 
              me give you a few statistics, overall 12% of voting age American 
              do not have a driver's license, most of whom are minority, new U.S. 
              citizens, the indigent, the elderly or the disabled. AARP reports 
              that 3.6 million disabled Americans have no driver's license. A 
              recent study in Wisconsin this year found that white adults were 
              twice as likely to have driver's licenses as African Americans over 
              18. In Louisiana, African Americans are four to five times less 
              likely to have photo IDs than white residents. 
             Now, why won't poor people 
              be able to get photo IDs or Real IDs? It's simple. Because they 
              cost money. You need a birth certificate, passport or proof naturalization 
              and that can cost up to $85. Then you need to go to the state office 
              to apply for a card. That requires time off work, possibly a long 
              trip on public transportation assuming there's an office near you. 
              Imagine if you only vote once ever two or four years, it's not very 
              likely you'll take time off work, take a bus to pay $85 just so 
              you can vote. That is not something that most folks are going to 
              be able to do. 
             The fact of the matter, 
              Mr. President, is that this is an idea that has been batted around 
              not with respect to immigration but with respect to generally attempting 
              to restrict the approach for people voting throughout the country. 
              This is not the time to do it. 
             The Carter-Baker commission 
              in 2002-2004 said fraudulent votes make up .000003% of the votes 
              cast. That's a lot of zeros. Let me say it a different way. Out 
              of almost 200 million votes that were cast during these elections, 
              52 were fraudulent. To put that into some context, you are statistically 
              more likely to get killed by lightning than to find a fraudulent 
              vote in a federal election. 
             Mr. President, this is 
              not the appropriate time to be debating this kind of amendment. 
              We've got a lot of serious issues with respect to immigration. I 
              would ask that all my colleagues reject the amendment so we can 
              move on to the important business at hand. Thank you, Mr. President.
