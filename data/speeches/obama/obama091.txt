            TOPIC: Oil & Alternative Fuels 
            Saturday, April 23, 2005 
            SIUC College of Agriculture's 50th Anniversary 
            Full Text of Barack Obama’s Speech    Thank 
              you. It's always great to be here in Carbondale, and a real honor 
              to speak here at SIUC's first Agriculture Industry Day. 
             Now, I'll be honest 
              - I haven't done all that much farming living on the South Side 
              of Chicago. But I have to say, my fondest farming memory is when 
              I once offered to help out a friend with his harvest. Knowing the 
              full range of my agricultural experience and expertise, he took 
              one look at me and said..."no thanks." 
             So when I saw 
              that you guys needed a keynote speaker for a lecture entitled, "Growing 
              the Food, Agriculture, and Natural Resource Economy in Southern 
              Illinois," I said "sign me up." 
             But seriously, 
              while I don't farm, what I did do during my eight years in the Illinois 
              State Senate, and what I'm doing now as a Senator in Washington, 
              is to constantly listen and learn from people who do farm and who 
              do know the business. And that has helped me tremendously in figuring 
              out how I can best stand up and speak out on the issues that matter 
              to family farmers and to the future of agriculture in this country. 
             Thanks to all 
              the hard work you're doing here at SIU, that future holds more promise 
              and more potential for America with each passing day. Because in 
              a world where globalization has made it possible for a student in 
              Carbondale to share ideas with one in Calcutta, yet necessary for 
              them to compete for the same jobs, the advances you're making in 
              agriculture could lead to the breakthroughs we need to maintain 
              America's global leadership in the years to come. 
             This is our new 
              challenge for the new century - and it's different than anything 
              we've ever faced before. 
             Just think about 
              what the world was like only fifty years ago, when the College of 
              Agriculture was a small, five-man department that taught its students 
              in a few old army barracks. Back then, the big challenge was navigating 
              the soils found in the hills and valleys of southern Illinois. If 
              you could master that, you were ready to graduate and live the farming 
              life, knowing that it would be enough to provide for you and your 
              family. 
             And even if you 
              didn't go to a fine school like SIU, in those days you still had 
              a shot at the American Dream. Because whether it was on the farm 
              or in a factory, a middle-class job that paid a decent wage and 
              good benefits was easy to come by - and it would probably last you 
              a lifetime. Hard work and sacrifice paid off for most families, 
              and because of the wealth they built, America's economic leadership 
              was unchallenged. 
             But the world 
              has certainly changed since then, hasn't it? 
             Today, even a 
              college degree doesn't guarantee a middle-class job that will support 
              a family. What's worse, the cost of getting that degree and the 
              price of health care on that job are rising higher and faster than 
              ever before. Family farmers are being squeezed by big agribusiness, 
              and factory jobs are heading across the ocean where labor is cheap. 
             We can make sure 
              that the new jobs and new industries that take their place stay 
              in America - but it won't happen by itself. Countries like India 
              and China are churning out more and more qualified college graduates 
              who can compete directly with Americans for jobs that can now be 
              done anywhere in the world. If we want to stay on top, we'll need 
              a nationwide commitment to better education, better training, and 
              the research and discovery that have always made America a land 
              of innovation and optimism. 
             This is where 
              you guys come in. 
             The title of this 
              lecture - "Growing the Food, Agriculture, and Natural Resource 
              Economy in Southern Illinois" - is really too narrow to capture 
              the full potential of the work you're doing here at the College 
              of Agriculture. Fifty years ago, it may have only been about the 
              economy in southern Illinois. Fifty years ago, the work you're doing 
              may not have had an impact beyond the farms and borders of a small 
              town like Carbondale. 
             But today we live 
              in a different world. 
             Today, a discovery 
              made right here in your Food and Nutrition department could save 
              a person from a lifetime of diabetes in southern California. An 
              SIU student who publishes a paper online about the benefits of soy 
              in preventing prostate cancer could attract the attention of a researcher 
              in Boston who's working on a cure. And a professor who makes a breakthrough 
              in developing drought-resistant crops could save millions from hunger 
              in Africa. 
             Today, the work 
              you're doing here not only has the potential to improve the lives 
              of people in Illinois and across the world; it offers the opportunity 
              to develop new ideas that will lead to new jobs and a new competitive 
              edge for America in the 21st century. This is the way we can win 
              in the global economy, and here at this school in this Illinois 
              small town, you're helping us get there. 
             Right now, researchers 
              at this college are studying ways to improve the production and 
              efficiency of ethanol. Again, this may sound small, but just imagine 
              what this could do for our country. 
             Any of you who've 
              pulled into a gas station lately have noticed how high the prices 
              are getting. You might have decided to drive your car less, or you 
              might have noticed that the cost of gas is cutting into your family 
              budget. The price of oil has now climbed to a record of over $50 
              a barrel, and we don't even know how much worse it's going to get. 
             So what do we 
              do about this? 
             We only have 3% 
              of the world's oil reserves - 65% of our oil is imported from the 
              Middle East. So unless we want to stay dependent forever on a region 
              of the world that's dangerous, politically unstable, and willing 
              to do lord-knows-what with the price of oil, we must find new sources 
              of energy here in America. 
             It seems like 
              politicians have been saying this forever. But when you look at 
              the record gas prices, and the possibility for more war and turmoil 
              in the Middle East, it's clear that we need less talk and more action. 
             We can start by 
              producing more ethanol in America. 
             The future of 
              energy in this country doesn't have to remain in the deserts of 
              the Middle East; we can find it in the corn fields of Illinois and 
              across the Midwest. 
             Imagine running 
              our cars with a fuel we can literally grow as much as we want of. 
              Imagine using a fuel that's clean and healthy, that's selling for 
              50 cents cheaper than gasoline, and that places America's energy 
              needs in America's hands. 
             This kind of future 
              is here - but to expand ethanol's promise across the nation, you 
              guys need to keep up the great research here and we need to step 
              up the legislative process in Washington. 
             Recently, I joined 
              a few other Senators in introducing a bill that would increase America's 
              renewable fuel standard and increase ethanol production along with 
              it. A bill like this that's already passed the Senate twice would've 
              provided us with 500,000 barrels a day of refined ethanol for use 
              in gasoline and would save us $4 billion every year in imported 
              oil and gasoline costs. 
             Just think of 
              what this would do for our economy. Farmers would earn more for 
              their corn, businesses would invest more in the type of community-sized 
              ethanol facilities that would grow the downstate economy, and over 
              200,000 jobs would be created. We've got bipartisan support for 
              this bill, so I'm pretty confident that this is the year we're finally 
              going to get it done. 
             The other ethanol 
              bill I've introduced would make it easier for more cars to be powered 
              by cheaper, cleaner, ethanol-based fuel. As most of you probably 
              know, there's a fuel known as E85 that's made from 85% ethanol and 
              15% gasoline. It's a great alternative to gasoline, but the only 
              problem is that we're in short supply of E85 fueling stations. Down 
              here in southern Illinois, you drive by miles and miles of corn 
              fields that can produce ethanol, but only 3 E85 stations in all 
              of southern Illinois, and not one in Carbondale. So the bill I'm 
              sponsoring would provide a tax credit of 50% to anyone who wants 
              to build an E85 fuel station. And to give consumers a good deal 
              too, it'll provide a tax credit of 35 cents per gallon of E85 fuel. 
              We've talked for too long about energy independence in this country, 
              and I think these proposals finally give us an opportunity to do 
              something about it. You've all been doing your part here at SIU, 
              and it's high time for Washington to do our part. 
             I've always believed 
              that the incredible story of progress that is America has been built 
              by those who ask why, what if, and why not - questions asked by 
              the very students at this college every day they choose to confront 
              the challenges of this new century. It is this fundamental character 
              of the American spirit - the desire to move forward, look around 
              the next corner, and reach for the unreachable - that put the first 
              man on the moon, led to a cure for polio, and launched the technological 
              revolution of the nineties. 
             And as the College 
              of Agriculture looks ahead to its next fifty years, we'd do well 
              to ask ourselves "What will they say about us at the 100th 
              anniversary?" As we face a new and different world that brings 
              both great promise and great peril, what will we do move America 
              towards a new and better day? 
             You won't find 
              the answers from your professors - and certainly not from politicians. 
              You'll find them by continuing to ask yourselves those questions 
              - why, what if, and why not. And as you keep studying and researching 
              here at school, remember that the answers you discover will not 
              only have an impact where you live and learn, but across a world 
              that is just waiting to hear from the next generation of dreamers. 
              Thank you.
