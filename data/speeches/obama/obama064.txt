            TOPIC: Ethics & Lobbying Reform

            Honest Leadership and Open Government

             As most of you know, I'm from Chicago - a city that 
              hasn't always had the cleanest reputation when it comes to politics 
              in this country. In fact, one of the most famous moments in Chicago 
              political life came back in the 50s, when one of Chicago's old-time 
              ward bosses, a guy named Paddy Bauer, was reported to have danced 
              on his chair after the Chicago machine defeated a reform candidate 
              and shouted out for the entire chamber to hear, that "Chicago 
              ain't ready for reform." 
             I stand here today with my colleagues to say that 
              the American people are ready for reform. 
             In fact, the American people think reform is long 
              overdue. 
             Now, let me say at the outset that none of us claim 
              that the Democrats have a monopoly on virtue. Moreover, political 
              corruption is not unique to Washington. During my first year in 
              the Illinois State Senate, I helped lead the fight to pass Illinois' 
              first ethics reform bill in twenty-five years - in part to address 
              some of the questionable practices that were going on in Springfield. 
             But I think it's fair to say that the scandals that 
              we've seen, both legal and illegal, under the current White House 
              and Congress, are far worse than most of us could have imagined. 
             Americans may have grown accustomed to big money 
              and special interests exerting too much influence in Washington, 
              but even they have been shocked by what appears to be a systematic 
              takeover of our democracy by high-priced lobbyists. 
             Think about it. In the past several months, we've 
              seen politicians resigning for taking millions of dollars in bribes. 
             We've seen the head of the White House procurement 
              office arrested. We've seen some of our most powerful leaders of 
              both the House and the Senate under federal investigation. We've 
              seen the number of registered lobbyists in Washington double since 
              George Bush came into office. And of course, we've seen the indictment 
              of Jack Abramoff. 
             Over the past few days, there have been suggestions 
              by Republican operatives and commentators that this is somehow a 
              bipartisan scandal. 
             But let's be clear - while the Democrats certainly 
              are not without sin when it comes to money in politics, Jack Abramoff 
              and Michael Scanlon and the K Street project - these are Republican 
              sins, and Republican sins alone. 
             What is also true is that the offenses involved 
              go beyond Jack Abramoff. They are bigger than golf junkets to Scotland 
              and lavish gifts for lawmakers. 
             The recent scandals have shaken the very foundation 
              of the American people's faith in a government that will look out 
              for their interests and uphold their values. 
             Because they don't just lead to morally offensive 
              conduct on the part of politicians. They lead to morally offensive 
              legislation that hurts hardworking Americans. 
             When big oil companies are invited into the White 
              House for secret energy meetings, it's no wonder they end up with 
              billions in tax breaks while Americans still struggle to fill up 
              their gas tanks and heat their homes. 
             When the halls of Congress are filled with high-priced 
              lobbyists from the pharmaceutical industry - some who used to be 
              members of Congress - it's hardly a surprise that they get taxpayer-funded 
              giveaways in the same Medicare bill that forbids seniors from banding 
              together to negotiate for better drug prices. 
             When the people running Washington are accountable 
              only to the special interests that fund their campaigns, of course 
              they'll spend your tax dollars with reckless abandon; of course 
              they'll load up bills with pet projects and driving us into deficit 
              with the hope that no one will notice. 
             At this point, the well-connected CEOs and hired 
              guns on K Street who've helped write our laws have gotten what they 
              paid for. They got all the tax breaks and loopholes and access they 
              could ever want. But outside this city, the people who can't afford 
              the high-priced lobbyists and don't want to break the law are wondering, 
              "When is it our turn? When will someone in Washington stand 
              up for me?" 
             We're here today to answer that call because let's 
              face it - for the last few years, the people running Washington 
              simply haven't. And while only some are to blame for the corruption 
              that has plagued this city, all are responsible for fixing it. 
             That's why we're asking Republicans to put an end 
              to the pay-to-play schemes and join us in passing the Honest Leadership 
              and Open Government Act, which should go a long way toward correcting 
              some of the most egregious offenses of the last few years. 
             You've already heard some of the key provisions 
              in our proposal. It will prevent former Members of Congress from 
              lobbying for legislation they were voting on just a year ago, it 
              will provide more transparency to allow the public to see exactly 
              what their representatives are doing in Washington, and it will 
              end the gifts and trips that allowed people like Jack Abramoff to 
              influence politicians. 
             I realize that our friends on the other side of 
              the aisle have suddenly found religion on this topic, and I think 
              that's commendable. In fact, I look forward to working in a bipartisan 
              fashion to get a solid bill passed. But let me close by saying that 
              it's going to take much more than gift bans and lobbying reform 
              to restore the public's faith in a government of, by, and for the 
              American people. 
             To earn back that trust - to show people that we're 
              working for them and looking out for their interests - we have to 
              start acting like it. 
             That means instead of meeting with lobbyists, it's 
              time to start meeting with some of the 45 million Americans with 
              no health care. Instead of hitting up the big firms on K Street, 
              it's time to start visiting the workers on Main Street who are wondering 
              how they'll send their kids to college or whether their pension 
              will be around when they retire. All these people have done to earn 
              access and gain influence is cast their ballot, but in this democracy, 
              it's all anyone should have to do. The people running this town 
              need to realize that, and if we hope to be real reformers, that's
